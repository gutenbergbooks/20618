<p>"The Boy Land Boomer" relates the adventures of a lad who, with
his father, joins a number of daring men in an attempt to occupy
the rich farming lands of Oklahoma before the time when that
section of our country was thrown open to settlement under the
homestead act.</p>
<p>Oklahoma consists of a tract of land which formerly formed a
portion of the Indian Territory. This region was much in dispute as
early as 1884 and 1885, when Captain "Oklahoma" Payne and Captain
Couch did their best to force an entrance for the boomers under
them. Boomers remained in the neighborhood for years, and another
attempt was made to settle Oklahoma in 1886, and up to 1889, when,
on April 22, the land was thrown open to settlement by a
proclamation of the President. The mad rush to gain the best claims
followed, and some of these scenes are related in the present
volume.</p>
<p>The boomers, who numbered thousands, had among them several
daring and well-known leaders, but not one was better known or more
daring than the leader who is known in these pages as Pawnee Brown.
This man was not alone a great Indian scout and hunter, but also
one who had lived much among the Indians, could speak their
language, and who had on several occasions acted as interpreter for
the Government. He was well beloved by his followers, who relied
upon his judgment in all things.</p>
<p>To some it may seem that the scenes in this book are overdrawn.
Such, however, is not the fact. There was much of roughness in
those days, and the author has continually found it necessary to
tone down rather than to exaggerate in penning these scenes from
real life.</p>

<h1>THE BOY LAND BOOMER</h1>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>DICK ARBUCKLE'S DISCOVERY.</h3>
<br />
<p>"Father!"</p>
<p>The call came from a boy of sixteen, a bright, manly chap, who
had just awakened from an unusually sound sleep in the rear end of
a monstrous boomer's wagon.</p>
<p>The scene was upon the outskirts of Arkansas City, situated near
the southern boundary line of Kansas and not many miles from the
Oklahoma portion of the Indian Territory.</p>
<p>For weeks the city had been filling up with boomers on their way
to pre-empt land within the confines of Oklahoma as soon as it
became possible to do so.</p>
<p>The land in Oklahoma had for years been in dispute. Pioneers
claimed the right to go in and stake out homesteads, but the
soldiers of our government would not allow them to do so.</p>
<p>The secret of the matter was that the cattle kings of that
section controlled everything, and as the grazing land of the
territory was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to them they
fought desperately to keep the pioneers out, delaying, in every
manner possible, legislation which tended to make the section an
absolutely free one to would-be settlers.</p>
<p>But now the pioneers, or boomers as they were commonly called,
were tired of waiting for the passage of a law which they knew must
come sooner or later, and they intended to go ahead without legal
authority.</p>
<p>It was a dark, tempestuous night, with the wind blowing fiercely
and the rain coming down at irregular intervals. On the grassy
plain were huddled the wagons, animals and trappings of over two
hundred boomers. Here and there flared up the remains of a
campfire, but the wind was blowing too strongly for these to be
replenished, and the men had followed their wives and children into
the big, canvas-covered wagons, to make themselves as comfortable
as the crowded space permitted.</p>
<p>It was the rattle of the rain on the canvas covering of the
wagon which had aroused the boy.</p>
<p>"I say father!" he repeated. "Father!"</p>
<p>Again there was no reply, and, kicking aside the blanket with
which he had been covered, Dick Arbuckle clambered over some boxes
piled high in the center of the vehicle to where he had left his
parent resting less than three hours before.</p>
<p>"Gone!" cried the lad in astonishment. "What can this mean? What
could take him outside in such a storm as this? Father!"</p>
<p>He now crawled to the opening at the front of the wagon and
called at the top of his voice. Only the shrieking of the wind
answered him. A dozen times he cried out, then paused to strike a
somewhat damp match and light a smoky lantern hanging to the front
ashen bow of the turn-out's covering. Holding the light over his
head he peered forth into the inky darkness surrounding the
boomer's temporary camp.</p>
<p>"Not a soul in sight," he mused. "It must be about midnight. Can
something have happened to father? He said he felt rather strange
in his head when he went to bed. If only Jack Rasco would come
back."</p>
<p>From the front end of the wagon Dick Arbuckle shifted back to
the rear. Here the same dreary outlook of storm, mud and flapping
canvases presented itself. Not so much as a stray dog was in sight,
and the nearest wagon was twenty feet away.</p>
<p>"I must find out where he is. Something is wrong, I feel certain
of it."</p>
<p>Thus muttering to himself the youth hunted up his overcoat and
hat, put them on, and, lantern in hand, swung himself into the sea
of half-submerged prairie grass, and stalked over to the other
wagon just mentioned.</p>
<p>"Mike Delaney!" he cried, kicking on the wagon wheel with the
toe of his boot; "Mike Delaney, have you seen my father
anywhere?"</p>
<p>"Sure, an' Moike Delaney is not here, Dick Arbuckle," came in a
female voice. "He's gone off wid Pawnee Brown, and there's no
tellin' whin he'll be back. Is yer father gone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I don't know where," and now Dick stepped closer, as
the round and freckled face of Rosy Delaney peered forth from a
hole in the canvas end. "He went to bed when I did, and now he's
missing."</p>
<p>"Saints preserve us! Mebbe the Injuns scalped him now, Dick!"
came in a voice full of terror.</p>
<p>"There are no Indians around here, Mrs. Delaney," answered the
youth, half inclined to laugh. "But he's missing, and it's mighty
strange, to say the least."</p>
<p>"He was sick, too, wasn't he?"</p>
<p>"Father hasn't been real well for a year. He left New York very
largely in the hope that this climate would do him some good."</p>
<p>"Moike was sayin' his head throubles him a good bit."</p>
<p>"So it does, and that's why I am so worried. When he gets those
awful pains he is apt to walk away and keep right on without
knowing where he is going."</p>
<p>"Poor mon! Oi wisht Oi could help yez. Mebbe Moike will be back
soon. Ain't Jack Rasco about?"</p>
<p>"No, he is off with Pawnee Brown, too. Rasco and Brown have been
looking over the trails leading to Oklahoma. They are bound to
outwit the United States cavalry, for the boomers have more right
to that land than the cattle kings, and right is always might in
the end."</p>
<p>"Especially wid Pawnee on the end o' it, Dick. He's a great mon,
is Pawnee, only it do be afther givin' me the shivers to hear him
spake the Pawnee language loike he was a rale Injun. Such a foine
scout as he is has no roight to spake such a dirthy tongue. How
illegant it would be now if he could spake rale Oirish."</p>
<p>"His knowledge of the Indian tongue has helped both him and our
government a good deal, Mrs. Delaney. But I mustn't stop here
talking. If my father&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>A wild, unearthly shriek cut short further talk upon Dick
Arbuckle's part. It came from the darkness back of the camp and
caused Mrs. Delaney to draw back and tumble to the bottom of her
house on wheels in terror.</p>
<p>"It's the Banshee&#8212;&#8212;" she began, when Dick
interrupted her.</p>
<p>"It's Pumpkin Bill. I'd know his voice a mile off," he declared.
"Somebody ought to send him back to where he belongs. Creation,
what a racket!"</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the voice, rising and falling with the
wind. The shrill shrieking penetrated to every wagon, and head
after head was thrust out of the canvases to see what it meant. In
another minute Pumpkin Bill, the dunce of the boomer's camp, "a
nobody from nowhar," to use Cal Clemmer's words, came rushing
along, hatless and with his wild eyes fairly starting from their
sockets.</p>
<p>"Save me! a ghost!" he yelled, swinging his hands over his head.
"A ghost full of blood! Oh, oh! I'm a dead boy! I know I am! Stop
him from following me!"</p>
<p>"Pumpkin!" ejaculated Dick, striding up and catching the fleeing
lad by the arm. "Hold on; what's this racket about?"</p>
<p>The dunce paused, then stood stock still, his mouth opening to
its widest extent. He was far from bright, and it took him several
seconds to put into words what was passing in his mind.</p>
<p>"About, about?" he repeated. "Dick Arbuckle! Oh, dear me! I've
seen your father's ghost!"</p>
<p>"Pumpkin!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. Hope to die if I didn't. I was just coming to camp
from town. Some men kept me, and made me sing and dance for
them&#8212;you know how I can sing&#8212;tra-la-la-da-do-da-bum!
They promised me a dollar, but didn't give it to me. I was running
to get out of the wet when I plumped into something fearful&#8212;a
ghost! Your father, covered with blood, and groaning and moaning,
'Robbed, robbed; almost murdered!' That's what the ghost said, and
he caught me by the hand. See, the blood is there yet, even though
I did try to wash it off in the rain. Oh, Dick, what does it
mean?"</p>
<p>"It means something awful has happened, Pumpkin, if your story
is true&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Hope to die if it ain't," and the dunce crossed his heart
several times. Suddenly, to keep up his courage, he burst into a
wild snatch of song:</p>
<span style="margin-left:15.0em;">"A big baboon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:15.0em;">Glared at the moon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:16.0em;">And sang
la-la-la-dum!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:15.0em;">'Come down to me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:15.0em;">And I will be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:16.0em;">Your
lardy-dardy&#8212;&#8212;'"</span><br />
<p>"Stop it, Pumpkin," interrupted Dick. "Come along with me."</p>
<p>"To where?"</p>
<p>"To where you saw my father."</p>
<p>"Not for a million dollars&#8212;not for a million million!"
cried the half-witted boy. "It wasn't your father; it was a ghost,
all covered with blood!" and he shrank back under the Delaney
wagon.</p>
<p>"It was my father, Pumpkin; I am sure of it. He is missing, and
something has happened to him. Perhaps he fell and hurt himself.
Come on."</p>
<p>The dunce stopped short and stared.</p>
<p>"Missing, is he? Then it wasn't a ghost. La-la-dum! What a joke.
Will you go along, too?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"And take a pistol?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Poor mon, Oi thrust he is not very much hurted," broke in Rosy
Delaney, who had been a close listener to the foregoing. "If he is,
Dick Arbuckle, bring him here, an' it's Rosy Delaney will nurse him
wid th' best of care."</p>
<p>As has been said, many had heard Pumpkin Bill's wild cries, but
now that he had quieted down these boomers returned to their
couches, grumbling that the half-witted lad should thus be allowed
to disturb their rest.</p>
<p>In a minute Dick Arbuckle and Pumpkin were hurrying along the
road the dunce had previously traveled. The rain was letting up a
bit, and the smoky lantern lit up the surroundings for a circle
thirty feet in diameter.</p>
<p>"Here is where I met him," said Pumpkin, coming to a halt near
the edge of a small stream. "There's the hat he knocked off my
head." He picked it up. "Oh, dear me! covered with blood! Did you
ever see the like?"</p>
<p>Dick was more disturbed than ever.</p>
<p>"Which way did he go?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Didn't you notice at all, Pumpkin? Try to think."</p>
<p>"Nary a notice. I ran, that's all. It looked like a bloody
ghost. I'll dream about it, I know I will."</p>
<p>To this Dick did not answer. Getting down on his knees in the
wet he examined the trail by the lantern's rays. The footsteps
which he thought must be those of his father led around a bend in
the stream and up a series of rocks covered with moss and dirt.
With his heart thumping violently under his jacket he followed the
footprints until the very summit of the rocks was gained. Then he
let out a groan of anguish.</p>
<p>And not without cause. Beyond the summit was a dark opening
fifteen feet wide, a hundred or more feet long and of unfathomable
depth. The footprints ended at the very edge of this yawning
abyss.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>DICK ON A RUNAWAY.</h3>
<p>"If he fell down here he is dead beyond all doubt!"</p>
<p>Such were Dick Arbuckle's words as he tried in vain to pierce
the gloom of the abyss by flashing around the smoky lantern.</p>
<p>"Gosh! I reckon you're right," answered Pumpkin in an awe-struck
whisper. "It must be a thousand feet to the bottom of that
hole!"</p>
<p>"If I had a rope I might lower myself," went on the youth, with
quiet determination. "But without a rope&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>A pounding of hoof-strokes on the grassy trail below the rocks
caused him to stop and listen attentively.</p>
<p>"Somebody is coming. I'll see if I can get help!" he cried, and
ran down to the trail, swinging his lantern over his head as he
went. In ten seconds a horseman burst into view, riding a beautiful
racing steed. The newcomer was a well-known leader of the land
boomers, who rejoiced in the name of Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>"Ai! Pawnee Brown!" cried Dick, and at once the leader of the
land boomers came to a halt.</p>
<p>"What is it, Arbuckle?" he asked kindly.</p>
<p>"My father is missing, and I have every reason to fear that he
has tumbled into an opening at the summit of yonder rocks."</p>
<p>"That's bad, lad. Missing? Since when?"</p>
<p>Dick's story was soon told, and Pawnee Brown at once agreed to
go up to the opening and see if anything could be done. "It's the
Devil's Chimney," he explained. "If he went over into it I'm afraid
he's a goner."</p>
<p>A lariat hung from the pommel of the scout's saddle, and this he
took in hand as he dismounted. Soon he stood by the edge of the
black opening, while Dick again waved the lantern.</p>
<p>"You and the dunce can lower me by the lariat. I don't believe
the opening is more than fifty feet deep," said Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>The lariat was quickly adjusted around the edge of a smooth
rock, and with his foot in a noose and the lantern in hand, the
scout was lowered into the depths of the opening.</p>
<p>Down and down he went, the light finding nothing but bare, rocky
wall to fall upon. Presently the lowering process ceased.</p>
<p>"We have reached the end of the lariat," called out Dick.</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken when a fearful thing happened. There was a
snap and a whirr, and Dick and Pumpkin went flat on their backs,
while ten feet of the lariat whirled loosely over their heads.</p>
<p>The improvised rope had broken.</p>
<p>"Gone!" gasped Dick. "Merciful heavens!"</p>
<p>He scrambled up and looked over the edge of the opening. The
lantern had been dashed into a thousand pieces, and all was dark
below.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" he cried, and Pumpkin joined in with a cry which
was fairly a shriek.</p>
<p>The opening remained as silent as a tomb. Again and again both
called out. Then Dick turned to his companion.</p>
<p>"This is awful, Pumpkin. Something must be done. I shall mount
his mare and ride back to camp and get help. For all I know to the
contrary both my father and Pawnee Brown are lying dead below."</p>
<p>"I shan't stay here alone," shivered the half-witted boy. Then,
before Dick could stop him, he set off at the top of his speed,
yelling discordantly as he went.</p>
<p>"Poor fool, he might have ridden with me," thought Dick.</p>
<p>He was already rushing down to the trail. Now he remembered that
he had heard a strange noise down where Pawnee Brown's beautiful
mare, Bonnie Bird, had been tethered&#8212;a noise reaching him
just before the lariat had parted. What could that mean?</p>
<p>He reached the clump of trees where Bonnie Bird should have
been. The mare was gone!</p>
<p>"Broken away!" he groaned. "Was ever such luck before!
Everything is going wrong tonight! Poor father; poor Pawnee Brown!
I must leg it to camp just as Pumpkin is doing. Hullo!"</p>
<p>He had started to run, but now he pulled up short. Grazing in
the wet grass not a dozen steps away was a bay horse, full and
round, a perfect beast. At first Dick Arbuckle thought he must be
dreaming. He ran up rubbing his eyes. No, it was no dream; the
horse was as real as a horse could be. He was bridled, but instead
of a saddle wore only a patch of a blanket.</p>
<p>"It's a Godsend," he murmured. "I don't know whom you belong to,
old boy, but you've got to carry me back to camp, and that, too, at
a licking gait, you understand?"</p>
<p>The horse pricked up his ears and gave a snort. In a trice Dick
was on his back and urging him around in the proper direction. He
was a New York boy, not much used to riding, and the management of
such a beast as this one did not come easy. The horse arose upon
his forelegs and nearly pitched Dick over his head, and the youth
had to cling fast around his neck to save himself a lot of broken
bones.</p>
<p>"Whoa, there! Gee Christopher, what a tartar! Whoa, I say! If
only I had a whip!" he panted, as the horse began to move around on
a pivot. "Now, why can't you act nice, when I'm in such dire need
of your services? If you don't stop&#8212;Whoa! whoa!"</p>
<p>For the horse had suddenly stopped pivoting and started off like
a streak, not up or down the trail, but across a stretch of prairie
grass. On and on he went, the bit between his teeth and gaining
speed at every step. In vain Dick yelled at him, kicked him and
banged him on the head. It was of no use, and he had to cling on
for dear life.</p>
<p>"I might as well let him go and jump for it," he thought at
last, when nearly a mile had been covered. "It's just as useless to
try to stop him as it would be to stop a limited express. If I jump
off&#8212;but I won't, now!"</p>
<p>For the prairie had been left behind, and the bay was tearing
along a rocky trail leading to goodness knew where, so Dick
thought. A jump now would mean broken bones, perhaps death. He
clung tighter than ever, and tried to calm the horse by speaking
gently to him.</p>
<p>At first the beast would not listen, but finally, when several
miles had been covered he slackened up, and at last dropped into a
walk. He was covered with foam, and now he was quite willing to be
led.</p>
<p>"You old reprobate!" muttered Dick, as he tightened his hold on
the reins. "Now where in the name of creation have you brought me
to, and how am I to find my way back to camp from here?"</p>
<p>Sitting upright once again, the youth tried to pierce the
darkness. The rain had stopped, only a few scattering drops falling
upon himself and the steaming animal, but the darkness was as great
as ever.</p>
<p>On two sides of him were forest lands, on the third a slope of
rocks and on the fourth a stretch of dwarf grass. The trail, if
such it could be called, ran along the edge of the timber. Should
he follow this? He moved along slowly, wondering whether he was
right or wrong.</p>
<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>
<p>It was a military challenge, coming out of the darkness. Dick
stopped the horse, and presently made out the form of a man on
horseback, a cavalryman.</p>
<p>"I'm a friend who has lost the way," began the youth, when the
cavalryman let out a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>"Tucker's horse, hang me if it isn't! Boy, where did you get
that nag? Tucker, Ross, come here! I've collared one of the
horse-thieves!"</p>
<p>In a moment more there came the clatter of horses' hoofs through
the timber, and Dick found himself surrounded by three big and
decidedly ugly-looking United States cavalrymen&#8212;troopers who
belonged to a detachment set to guard the Oklahoma territory from
invasion.</p>
<p>"A boy and a boomer!" ejaculated the fellow named Tucker. "I saw
the kid over near Arkansas City a couple of days ago. And riding
Chester, too! Git off that hoss, before I kick you off!"</p>
<p>And riding up he caught Dick by the collar and yanked him to the
ground. In an instant he was beside the boy and had produced a pair
of reservation handcuffs.</p>
<p>"Out with your hands, sonny, and be quick about it."</p>
<p>"What for?" asked Dick, somewhat bewildered by the unceremonious
way in which he was being handled. "I didn't steal that horse."</p>
<p>"Too thin, sonny. All you boomers are a set of thieves, and I
suppose you think stealing our hossflesh is the rarest kind of a
joke. Out with those hands, I say, and consider yourself a prisoner
of Uncle Sam. You've nearly ridden Chester to death and for two
pins I'd take the law into my own hands and string you up to the
nearest tree. Take that!"</p>
<p>And having handcuffed Dick the cavalryman let out with his heavy
right hand and landed a savage slap that sent the helpless youth
headlong at his feet.</p>
<p>The blow aroused all of the lion in the youth's makeup. As
quickly as he could he leaped up.</p>
<p>"You brute!" he cried. "Why don't you fight fair? Take that, and
that and that!"</p>
<p>Each "that" meant two blows, for Dick could not separate his
hands, and therefore struck out with both at a time&#8212;two in
the chest, two on the chin and the final pair on either side of
Tucker's big and reddish nose. The cavalryman, taken by surprise,
let out a cry of rage and pain.</p>
<p>"You imp!" he screamed. "To hit a man in uniform! I'll show you
what I can do! How do you like that?"</p>
<p>With incredible swiftness he drew his heavy Sabra and leaped
upon Dick. The boy tried to retreat, but slipped on the wet ground
and went down. On the instant Tucker was upon him, and, with a
fierce cry, the infuriated cavalryman raised his blade over Dick's
head.</p>

<h3>A CAVE AND A CAVE-IN.</h3>
<p>Let us go back and see what happened to Pawnee Brown at the time
the lariat parted and he found himself going down into what seemed
bottomless space.</p>
<p>Instinctively he put out both hands as far as he was able, to
grasp anything which might come within reach and thereby check his
awful downward course.</p>
<p>The lantern fell from his fingers and jingled to pieces on a
protruding rock.</p>
<p>Then his right hand slid over the ends of a bush growing out of
a fissure. He caught the bush and held on like grim death.</p>
<p>The bush gave way, but not instantly, and his descent was
checked so that the tumble to the bottom of the hole, fifteen feet
further down, was not near as bad as it would otherwise have
been.</p>
<p>Yet he came down sideways, and his head striking a flat rock, he
was knocked insensible.</p>
<p>Half an hour went by, and he opened his eyes in a wondering way.
Where was he and what had happened?</p>
<p>Soon the truth burst upon him, and he staggered to his feet to
see if any bones had been broken.</p>
<p>"All whole yet, thanks to my usual good luck," he thought. "But
that's a nasty lump on the back of my head. Hullo, up there!"</p>
<p>He called out as loudly as he could, but no answer came back,
for Dick and Pumpkin were already gone.</p>
<p>"Well, I always allowed that I would explore the Devil's Chimney
some day, but I didn't calculate to do it quite so soon," he went
on. "What can have become of those boys? Have they deserted me or
gone off for help? If I can read character I fancy that Dick
Arbuckle will do all he can for me&#8212;and, by the way, can his
father's corpse really be down here?"</p>
<p>He brought forth a match and lit it. The battered lantern lay
close at hand, and, although without a glass, it was still better
than nothing, and, turned well up, gave forth a torch-like flame
which lit up the surroundings for a dozen feet or more. No body was
there, nor did he find any for the full distance up and down the
dismal hole.</p>
<p>"The boy was mistaken; his father wandered elsewhere," was the
boomer's conclusion. "Poor fellow, he was in no mental or physical
condition to push his claims in the West. He should have remained
at home and allowed some hustling Western lawyer to act for him. If
he falls into the clutches of some of our land agents they'll
swindle him out of every cent of his fortune. I must give him and
the boy the tip when I get the chance." The great scout laughed
softly. "When I get the chance is good. I reckon I had best pull
myself out of this man-trap first."</p>
<p>He made a careful investigation of the rocks. At no point was
there anything which gave promise of a footing to the top.</p>
<p>"In a pocket and no error," he mused. "I wonder if I've got to
stay here like a bull-croaker at the bottom of a well?"</p>
<p>The rain had formed a long pool between the slanting rocks. He
threw a chip into this pool and saw that it drifted slowly off
between two scrub bushes growing partly under a shelving rock.</p>
<p>With the light he made an inspection of the locality, and a cry
of surprise escaped him. Beyond the bushes was the opening to an
irregular, but apparently large cavern.</p>
<p>The stream flowed along one side of the flooring to this
opening.</p>
<p>"Must be some sort of an outlet beyond," he mused. "I'll try it
and see," and in a moment more he was inside of the cavern and
crawling along on hands and knees.</p>
<p>He had not far to go in this fashion. Twenty feet beyond the
cavern became so large that he could stand up with ease. He flashed
the light above his head.</p>
<p>"By Jove! a miniature Mammoth Cave of Kentucky!" burst from his
lips.</p>
<p>On he went until a bend in the formation of the cavern was
gained. Here the stream of water disappeared under a pile of loose
stones, and the opening became less than six feet in height.</p>
<p>"Checked!" he muttered, and his face fell. It looked as if he
would have to go back the way he had come.</p>
<p>Again he raised his light and gazed about him with more care
than ever.</p>
<p>The loose rocks soon caught his attention, and, setting down the
lantern, he began to pull away first at one and then another.</p>
<p>The last turned back, he saw another opening, evidently leading
upward.</p>
<p>"This must lead to the open air&#8212;" he began, when a
grinding of stone caught his ears. In a twinkle a veritable shower
of rocks came down around his head. He was knocked flat and almost
covered.</p>
<p>For fully ten minutes he lay gasping for breath. The blood was
flowing from a wound on his cheek, and it was a wonder that he had
not been killed.</p>
<p>"In the future I'll have more care," he groaned, as, throwing
first one stone and then another aside, he sat up. The falling of
the stones had been followed by some dirt, and now a regular
landslide came after, burying him up to the armpits.</p>
<p>"Planted," was the single word which issued from his lips. He
was not seriously hurt, and was half inclined to laugh at his
predicament. Still, on the whole, it was no laughing matter, and
Pawnee Brown lost no time in trying to dig himself free.</p>
<p>The stones and dirt were wedged tightly about his legs, and not
wishing to run the risk of a broken or twisted ankle, the scout
worked with care, all the time wondering if Dick Arbuckle was back,
and never once dreaming of the peril the poor lad was encountering.
The rain was soaking through the ceiling of the cavern, and the
situation was far from a comfortable one.</p>
<p>At last he was free again, and striking a match, he hunted up
the lantern and lit it once more.</p>
<p>The opening to the inner cave was now large enough to pass
through with ease, and making sure of his footing, the scout moved
forward, straining his eyes eagerly for some sign of an egress to
the outer world.</p>
<p>Presently he saw a number of straggly things dangling downward
from the rocks and soil overhead.</p>
<p>They were the bottom roots of some great tree standing fifteen
or twenty feet above.</p>
<p>"Not far from the surface now, that's certain," he thought, with
considerable satisfaction. "And yet, hang me if I can see an
opening of any sort yet."</p>
<p>On and on he went, until nearly a hundred feet more had been
passed.</p>
<p>The cave had widened out, but now it narrowed once again to less
than a dozen feet. The roof, too, sloped downward until it
occasionally scraped the crown of his sombrero.</p>
<p>The light of the lantern began to splutter and flare up, showing
that the oil in the cup was running low.</p>
<p>"If only the thing lasts until I find the door to this
confounded prison," he thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly a peculiar hiss sounded out upon the darkness.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown knew that hiss only too well, and leaping back he
snatched a pistol from his belt.</p>
<p>The hiss was followed by a rattle, and now, flashing the light
around, the scout saw upon a flat rock the curled-up form of a huge
rattlesnake.</p>
<p>The eyes of the reptile shone like twin stars, and when Pawnee
Brown discovered him he was getting ready to strike.</p>
<p>The rattler was less than six feet away, and the scout knew that
he could cover that space with ease. Therefore, whatever was to be
done must be done quickly.</p>
<p>Like a flash the pistol came up. But ere Pawnee Brown could fire
a curious thing happened.</p>
<p>A large drop of water, splashing down from the roof of the
cavern, caused the light to splutter and go out.</p>
<p>The scout was in the dark with his enemy.</p>
<p>More than this, he was boxed up in a narrow place, from which
escape was well-nigh impossible.</p>
<p>Aiming as best he could under the circumstances, he fired.</p>
<p>The bullet struck the flat rock, bounded up to the side wall of
the cavern and then hit him in the leg.</p>
<p>"Missed, by thunder!"</p>
<p>He jumped past the spot and moved up the cavern a distance of
several yards.</p>
<p>A rattle and a whirr followed, as the great rattlesnake made a
vicious strike in the dark. An intense hiss sounded out when the
reptile realized that the object of his anger had been missed.</p>
<p>Listening with strained ears, the boomer heard the deadly thing
sliding slowly from rock to rock, coming closer at every
movement.</p>
<p>To flee was impossible, so with bated breath he stood his
ground.</p>
<hr width="30%" size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>OUT OF THE CAVERN.</h3>
<p>Slowly but surely the great rattlesnake came closer to where
Pawnee Brown stood motionless in the darkness of the cavern.</p>
<p>The reptile had been enraged by the shot the great scout fired,
and now meant to strike, and that fatally.</p>
<p>Listening with ears strained to their utmost, the boomer heard
the form of the snake slide from rock to rock of the uneven
flooring.</p>
<p>The rattler was all of ten feet long and as thick around as a
good-sized fence rail.</p>
<p>One square strike from those poisonous fangs and Pawnee Brown's
hours would be numbered.</p>
<p>Yet the scout did not intend to give up his life just now. He
still held his pistol, four chambers of which were loaded.</p>
<p>"If only I had a light," he thought.</p>
<p>Retreat was out of the question. A single sound and the
rattlesnake would have been upon him like a flash.</p>
<p>It was only the darkness and the utter silence that made the
reptile cautious.</p>
<p>Suddenly the scout heard a scraping on the rocks less than three
feet in front of him.</p>
<p>The time for action had come; another moment and the rattler
would be wound around his legs.</p>
<p>Crack! crack! Two reports rang out in quick succession and by
the flash of the first shot Pawnee Brown located those glittering
eyes.</p>
<p>The second shot went true to its mark, and the rattler dropped
back with a hole through its ugly head.</p>
<p>The long, whip like body slashed hither and thither, and the
scout had to do some lively sprinting to keep from getting a tangle
and a squeeze.</p>
<p>As he hopped about he struck a match, picked up the lantern,
shook the little oil remaining into the wick and lit it. Another
shot finished the snake and the body curled up into a snarl and a
quiver, to bother him no more.</p>
<p>It was then that Pawnee Brown paused, drew a deep breath and
wiped the cold perspiration from his brow.</p>
<p>"By gosh! I've killed fifty rattlers in my time, but never one
in this fashion," he murmured. "Wonder if there are any more
around?"</p>
<p>He knew that these snakes often travel in pairs, and as he went
on his way he kept his eyes wide open for another attack.</p>
<p>But none came, and now something else claimed his attention.</p>
<p>The cavern was coming to an end. The side walls closed in to
less than three feet, and the flooring sloped up so that he had to
crouch down and finally go forward on his hands and knees.</p>
<p>The lantern now went out for good, every drop of oil being
exhausted.</p>
<p>At this juncture many a man would have halted and turned back to
where he had come from, but such was not Pawnee Brown's
intention.</p>
<p>"I'll see the thing through," he muttered. "I'd like to know how
far I am from the surface of the ground."</p>
<p>A dozen yards further and the cavern become so small that
additional progress was impossible.</p>
<p>He placed his hand above him and encountered nothing but dirt,
with here and there a small stone.</p>
<p>With care he began to dig away at the dirt with his knife. Less
than a foot of the cavern ceiling had thus been dug away when the
point of the knife brought down a small stream of water.</p>
<p>Feeling certain he was now close to the surface, he continued to
work with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>"At last!"</p>
<p>The scout was right. The knife had found the outer air, and a
dim, uncertain light struck down upon the hero of the plains.</p>
<p>It did not take long to enlarge the opening sufficiently to
admit the passage of Pawnee Brown's body.</p>
<p>He leaped out among a number of bushes and stretched
himself.</p>
<p>Having brushed the dirt from his wet clothing, he "located
himself," as he put it, and started up a hill to the entrance to
the Devil's Chimney.</p>
<p>He was on the side opposite to that from which he had descended,
and, in order to get over, had to make a wide detour through some
brush and small timber.</p>
<p>This accomplished, he hurried to where he had left Bonnie Bird
tethered.</p>
<p>As the reader knows, the beautiful mare was gone, and had been
for some time.</p>
<p>"I suppose that young Arbuckle took her," he mused. "But, if so,
why doesn't he come back here with her?"</p>
<p>There being no help for it, the scout set off for the camp of
the boomers on foot.</p>
<p>He was just entering the temporary settlement when he came face
to face with Jack Rasco, another of the boomers.</p>
<p>"Pawnee!" shouted the boomer, "You air jess the man I want ter
see. Hev ye sot eyes on airy o' the Arbuckles?"</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Dick Arbuckle now," answered the scout. "Isn't
he in the camp? I thought he came here with my mare?"</p>
<p>"He ain't nowhar. Rosy Delaney says he went off with Pumpkin to
look for his dad, who had disappeared&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Then he didn't come back? What can have become of him and
Bonnie Bird?" Pawnee Brown's face grew full of concern. "Something
is wrong around here, Jack," he continued, and told the boomer of
what had happened up at the Devil's Chimney. "First it's the
father, and now it's the son and my mare. I must investigate
this."</p>
<p>"I'm with yer, Pawnee&#8212;with yer to the end. Yer know
thet."</p>
<p>"Yes, Jack; you are one of the few men I know I can trust in
everything. But two of us are not enough. If harm has befallen the
Arbuckles it is the duty of the whole camp&#8212;or, at least,
every man in it&#8212;to try to sift matters to the bottom."</p>
<p>"Right ye air, Pawnee. I'll raise a hullabaloo and rouse 'em
up."</p>
<p>Jack Rasco was as good as his word. Going from wagon to wagon,
he shook the sleepers and explained matters. In less than a quarter
of an hour a dozen stalwart boomers were in the saddle, while Jack
Rasco brought forth an extra horse of his own for Brown's use.</p>
<p>"Has anybody seen the dunce?" questioned the scout.</p>
<p>No one had since he had gone off with Dick to look for the
so-called ghost.</p>
<p>"We will divide up into parties of two," said Pawnee Brown, and
this was done, and soon he and Jack Rasco were bounding over the
trail leading toward the Indian Territory, while others were
setting off in the direction of Arkansas City and elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Something curious about them air Arbuckles," observed Rasco as
they flew along side by side. "Mortimer Arbuckle said as how he was
coming hyer fer his health, but kick me ef I kin see it."</p>
<p>"I think myself the man has an axe to grind," responded the
leader of the boomers. "You know he came West to see about some
land."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know thet. But thar's somethin' else, sure ez shootin' ez
shootin', Pawnee. It kinder runs in my noddle thet he is a'lookin'
fer somebuddy."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Ah, thar's where ye hev got me. But I'll tell ye something. One
night when the boy wuz over ter Arkansas City the old man war
sleeping in the wagon, an' he got a nightmare. He clenched his
fists an' begun ter moan an' groan. 'Don't say I did it, Bolange,'
he moans. 'Don't say that&#8212;it's an awful crime! Don't put the
blood on my head!' an' a lot more like thet, till my blood most run
cold an' I shook him ter make him wake up. Now, don't thet look
like he had something on his mind?"</p>
<p>"It certainly does, and yet the man is not quite right in his
upper story, although I wouldn't tell the son that, Rasco. But what
was the name he mentioned?"</p>
<p>"Bolange, or Volange, or something like thet. It seems ter me he
hollered out Louis onct, too."</p>
<p>A sudden light shone in the great scout's eyes. He gripped his
companion by the arm.</p>
<p>"Try to think, Jack. Did Arbuckle speak the name of
Vorlange&#8212;Louis Vorlange?"</p>
<p>"By gosh! Pawnee, you hev struck it&#8212;Vorlange, ez plain ez
day. Do yer know the man?"</p>
<p>"Do I know him?" Pawnee Brown drew a long breath. "Jack, I
believe I once told you about my schoolboy days at Wellington and
elsewhere before I left home to take up a life on the cattle
trails?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Pawnee. From all accounts you wuz cut out for a
schoolmaster, instead of a leader of us boomers."</p>
<p>"I was a professor once at the Indian Industrial school at
Pawnee Agency. That is where I got to be called Pawnee Brown, and
where the Pawnees became so friendly that they made me their white
chief. But I aspired to something more than teaching and more than
cow punching in those boyhood days at Wellington; I wanted to have
a try at entrance to West Point and follow in the footsteps of
Grant and Custer, and fellows of that sort."</p>
<p>"Ye deserved it, I'll bet, Pawnee."</p>
<p>"I worked hard for it, and at last I got a chance to compete at
the examination. Among the other boys who competed was Louis
Vorlange. He had been the bully of our school, and more than once
we had fought, and twice I had sent him to bed with a head that was
nearly broken. He hated me accordingly, and swore I should not win
the prize I coveted."</p>
<p>"Did he try, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but he was outclassed from the start, for, although he was
sly and shrewd, book learning was too much for him. The examination
came off, and I got left, through Vorlange, who stole my papers and
changed many of my answers. I didn't learn of this until it was too
late. My chance of going to West Point fell through. There was
nothing to do but to thrash Vorlange, and the day before I left
home I gave him a licking that I'll wager he'll remember to the day
of his death. As it was, he tried to shoot me, but I collared the
pistol, and for that dastardly attack knocked two of his teeth down
his throat."</p>
<p>"Served him right, Pawnee. But I don't see whar&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute, Jack. I said Vorlange didn't go to West
Point; but he was strong with the politicians, and as soon as he
was old enough he got a position under the government, and now I
understand he is somewhere around the Indian Territory acting as a
spy for the land department."</p>
<p>"By gosh! I see. An' ye think Mortimer Arbuckle knows this same
chap?"</p>
<p>"It would look so. If I can read faces, the old man is innocent
of wrong-doing, and if that is so and there is the secret of a
crime between him and Louis Vorlange you can wager Vorlange is the
guilty party."</p>
<p>"Pawnee, you hev a head on yer shoulders fit fer a judge, hang
me ef ye ain't," burst out Jack Rasco admiringly. "I wish yer would
talk to Arbuckle the next time he turns up. Mebbe yer kin lift a
weight off o' his shoulders. The poor old fellow&#8212;creation!
wot's that?"</p>
<p>Jack Rasco stopped short and pulled up his horse. A wild,
unearthly scream rent the air, rising and falling on the wind of
the night. The scream was followed by a burst of laughter which was
truly demoniacal.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown pulled his horse up on his haunches. What was this
new mystery which confronted him?</p>
<p>Again the cry rang out; but now the scout recognized it and a
faint smile shone upon his face.</p>
<p>"It's the dunce," he exclaimed. "Pumpkin! Pumpkin! Come
here!"</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed and he called again. Then from the
brush which grew among the rocks emerged the form of the
half-witted boy.</p>
<p>"Pumpkin, where is Dick Arbuckle?" questioned Pawnee Brown,
leaping to the ground and catching the lad by his arm.</p>
<p>"Lemme go! I didn't hurt him!" screamed Pumpkin. "He went that
way&#8212;like the wind&#8212;on a bay horse which was running
away. Oh, he's killed, I know he is!"</p>
<p>"You are sure of this?"</p>
<p>"Hope to die if it ain't so. Poor Dick! He'll be pitched off and
smashed up like his father was smashed up. Hurry, and maybe you can
catch him."</p>
<p>"I believe the dunce speaks the truth," broke in Jack Rasco.</p>
<p>"How long ago was this?"</p>
<p>"Not more'n an hour. Hurry up if you want to save him," and with
a yell such as he had uttered before, Pumpkin disappeared.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown and Rasco wasted no more time. Whipping up their
steeds, they set off on a rapid gallop in the direction the runaway
horse had pursued.</p>

<h3>THE CAVALRYMEN.</h3>
<p>Let us rejoin Dick Arbuckle at the time that the incensed
cavalryman, Tucker, was about to attack the hapless lad with his
heavy Sabra.</p>
<p>Had the cruel blow fallen as intended it is beyond dispute that
Dick would have been severely injured.</p>
<p>"Don't!" cried the boy, and then closed his eyes at the terrible
thought of such dire punishment so close at hand.</p>
<p>But just at that instant an interruption came from out of the
darkness of the brush.</p>
<p>"Hello, there! What are you up to?"</p>
<p>Tucker started, and the Sabra was turned aside to bury itself in
the exposed roots of a tree.</p>
<p>"If it ain't Pawnee Brown!" muttered another cavalryman, Ross by
name.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" burst from Dick's lips, joyfully, and, rising,
he attempted to rush toward his friend.</p>
<p>"Not so fast, boy!" howled Tucker, and caught the youth by the
collar.</p>
<p>"What's the meaning of this? What are you doing to that boy?"
asked Pawnee Brown as he rode closer, with Rasco beside him.</p>
<p>"He's a horse thief, and we are going to take him to our camp,"
answered Tucker, somewhat uneasily, for he had seen Pawnee Brown
before and knew he had a man of strong character with whom to
deal.</p>
<p>"A horse thief!" ejaculated Jack Rasco. "Say, sod'ger, yer
crazy! Thet boy a thief! Wall, by gum!"</p>
<p>"That boy is no thief," put in Pawnee Brown. "He belongs to our
camp, and is as square as they make them&#8212;I'll vouch for
it."</p>
<p>"I ain't taking the word of any boomer," muttered Tucker sourly.
"That kid&#8212;hold on! Don't shoot!"</p>
<p>And he dropped back in terror, for the great scout had drawn his
pistol like a flash.</p>
<p>"You'll take my word or take something else," came the stiff
response. "Be quick, now, and say which you choose."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean any harm, Pawnee. Maybe you don't know it, but
the boy is a thief just the same. We just caught him riding my
horse&#8212;this bay. My comrades can prove it."</p>
<p>"It's true," said Ross.</p>
<p>"True as gospel," added Skimmy, the third cavalryman. "We caught
him less than half an hour ago."</p>
<p>Without answering to this, Pawnee Brown turned to the youth.</p>
<p>"Tell me your yarn, Dick. I know there is some mistake
here."</p>
<p>"There is not much to tell, Major. When the lariat broke up at
the Devil's Chimney and I couldn't make you reply to my calls I ran
off to get help and a rope. I intended to ride your mare back to
camp, but when I got to where the mare had been tethered I found
her gone and this bay loafing around in her place. I got on the
bay, but, instead of riding to camp, the animal ran away with me
and brought me here. These fellows were mighty rough on me, and
that man was going to split my head open when you came along in the
nick of time."</p>
<p>"That's a neat fairy tale," sneered Tucker. "This horse was
stolen four hours ago. More than likely the boy couldn't manage him
and lost his way and the horse tried to get back to where he
belonged."</p>
<p>"That doesn't connect with what I know," answered Pawnee Brown,
quietly. "My mare was tethered where he went to look for her. I
might as well accuse you of riding down there, taking Bonnie Bird
and leaving this nag in her place."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to insinuate we are horse thieves?" cried Ross
hotly.</p>
<p>"I'm giving you as good as you send, that's all. Dick, have you
any idea where Bonnie Bird is?"</p>
<p>"Not the slightest, sir."</p>
<p>The great scout heaved a sigh. The little racing mare was the
very apple of his eye.</p>
<p>"I'll not give up the hunt until I have found her." He turned
again to the cavalrymen. "If the finest little black mare, with a
white blaze, that you ever saw strays into your camp remember she
belongs to me," he went on. "I want her returned at once, and if
anybody attempts to keep her there will be a hotter time than this
Territory has seen for many a day. Dick, hop up behind me," and he
turned to his horse.</p>
<p>"That boy is to remain here," blustered Tucker, growing red in
the face.</p>
<p>"Hardly, my bantam. Hop up, Dick, and we'll strike back for camp
before the sun comes up and see if the others who are on the search
have seen anything of your father. I saw nothing of him at the
bottom of the Devil's Chimney."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to have a lazy, good-for-nothing boomer lay it
over me&#8212;&#8212;" began Tucker, when once more the sight of
Pawnee Brown's pistol silenced him.</p>
<p>No more was said as the scout, Dick and Rasco rode away down the
trail by which they had come. But, once out of sight, Tucker raised
his fist and shook it savagely.</p>
<p>"I'll get square with you some day, Pawnee Brown, mark my
words!" he muttered between his set teeth.</p>
<p>"We'll all get square," said Ross. "I hate the sight of that
man."</p>
<p>"I understand the boomers have made him their leader," broke in
Skimmy. "If they have, he'll try to break through to Oklahoma as
sure as guns are guns."</p>
<p>"And he'll get shot, too," answered Tucker dryly. "The
lieutenant is having all of the boomers' movements watched."</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown will do his level best to give us the slip, see if
he don't," remarked Skimmy. "Four thousand boomers wouldn't make
him their leader for nothing."</p>
<p>Thus, talking among themselves, the three cavalrymen mounted
their horses and rode back to their various picket stations along
the boundary line of the Indian Territory.</p>
<p>They were a detachment of the Seventh United States Cavalry, and
the lieutenant referred to by Tucker was in command.</p>
<p>For over a month they had been watching the boomers assembling
in Kansas. Other portions of the United States troops were watching
the would-be Oklahoma settlers in Arkansas and Texas.</p>
<p>There was every prospect of a lively time ahead, and it was not
far off.</p>
<p>Reaching his station, Tucker drew from his pocket a briar-root
pipe, filled and lit it and began to puff away meditatively.</p>
<p>His face had been ugly before, but now as he began to meditate
it grew blacker than ever.</p>
<p>"Hang me, if everything ain't going wrong," he muttered. "I
won't stand it. I'll make a kick, and when I do&#8212;&#8212;" He
paused as a shadow among the trees caught his eye. "Who goes
there?" he called out and drew his pistol.</p>
<p>"A friend. Tucker, is that you?"</p>
<p>"Vorlange!" cried the cavalryman, and the next moment the
newcomer and the military man were face to face.</p>
<p>"It's about time you showed up," growled Tucker, after a brief
pause, during which the newcomer looked at him anxiously. "Say,
Vorlange, when do you intend to settle up with me. Give it to me
straight, now."</p>
<p>"That's why I left the trail to hunt you up, Tucker&#8212;I knew
you were anxious about that five hundred dollars."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I be? It took me a long time to save it&#8212;a
good sight longer than it did for you to gamble it away."</p>
<p>"Tucker, I didn't gamble that away&#8212;I'll swear it. I used
it in business."</p>
<p>"Business? What business have you got outside of your position
as a land office spy?"</p>
<p>"A good business, if you only knew it. I've been following up a
little deal that started in the East&#8212;in New York. Out there I
had to hire a fellow I could trust to work for me, and that took
most of the money. But the whole thing is coming my way now, and I
want to talk things over with you. How would you like to have a
thousand back in return for the five hundred you loaned me?"</p>
<p>"What sort of a game are you working on me now?"</p>
<p>"A square deal, Tucker. I've been keeping my eye on you, and I
reckon you are the fellow to do what I want done."</p>
<p>"And what do you want done?"</p>
<p>Vorlange stepped closer.</p>
<p>"The boomers are going to try to cross into Oklahoma either
to-morrow or day after. There will be a fight, I am certain of it,
and somebody will be shot and killed. When you fire I want you to
pick out your man&#8212;two men&#8212;or, rather, a man and a boy,
if you can do it. I may be on hand to take part myself, but there
is a possibility that I may be ordered elsewhere."</p>
<p>"And you are willing to pay me five hundred extra for picking
out my target, Vorlange?"</p>
<p>"You've struck it."</p>
<p>"Who is the man?"</p>
<p>"Can I trust you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown."</p>
<p>At the mention of the great scout's name Tucker started
back.</p>
<p>"Why&#8212;why do you want him knocked over?"</p>
<p>"He is my enemy. I have hated him from my boyhood!" cried Louis
Vorlange. "And there are other reasons&#8212;he stands in the way
of my pushing the scheme I mentioned."</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown was here but a short while ago. He insulted and
abused me," growled Tucker. "I'll put a bullet through him quick
enough if I get the chance&#8212;that is, in a skirmish. I don't
want to run any risk of being strung up for&#8212;you know."</p>
<p>"The shooting will be O. K., Tucker, and I'll help if I'm not
ordered away. Do it and the five hundred extra are yours, I'll give
you my word."</p>
<p>"What about that boy you mentioned?"</p>
<p>"His name is Dick Arbuckle. He is&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Dick Arbuckle? I know him. He stole my horse. I captured him
and Pawnee Brown came to his rescue and made me, Ross and Skimmy
give him up," and Tucker gave the particulars in his own version of
the affair.</p>
<p>"Then you bear the lad no love?"</p>
<p>"Love?" The cavalryman grated his teeth. "I was wishing I could
get a shot at him."</p>
<p>"Then keep that wish in mind, Tucker, when the time for action
arrives."</p>
<p>"If it's worth five hundred to you to have Pawnee Brown knocked
over it ought to be worth more to have both of 'em laid low,"
suggested Tucker, who was naturally a grasping fellow.</p>
<p>"Five hundred in cold cash is a good deal in these times," was
the slow answer. "But I'll tell you what I'll do. If, after a
fight, you can bring me absolute proof that Pawnee Brown and Dick
Arbuckle are dead I'll give you an even twelve hundred dollars, the
five hundred I borrowed and seven hundred extra. There's my hand on
it. What do you say?"</p>
<p>"Will you promise to give me the money as soon as you have the
proofs?"</p>
<p>"I will," and Louis Vorlange raised his right hand as though to
make good such a blasphemous promise.</p>
<p>"All right, then; I take you up," answered Tucker.</p>

<h3>DICK'S HUNT.</h3>
<p>"Don't you take it so hard, my lad; I feel certain that your
father will turn up sooner or later."</p>
<p>It was Pawnee Brown who spoke. He addressed Dick, who sat on a
horse belonging to Jack Rasco. The pair had been scouring the
plains and the woods for three hours in search of Dick's
father.</p>
<p>"Poor father! If only I knew what had become of him!" sighed the
lad.</p>
<p>In his anxiety he had forgotten all about his adventures among
the cavalrymen who had sought to detain him as a horse thief.</p>
<p>"It's a mystery, thet's what it is," burst in Jack Rasco.</p>
<p>"It looks loike the hivens hed opened an' swalleyed him up," was
Mike Delaney's comment. "Be jabbers, we all know th' hivens was
wide open enough last noight. Me turn-out is afther standin' in two
foot o' wather, an' Rosy raisin' the mischief because she can't go
out. 'Moike,' sez she, 'Moike Delaney, git a boat or Oi'll be
drowned,' an' niver a boat in sight. Th' ould woman will have to
shtay in the wagon till the wather runs off of itself."</p>
<p>"I wonder if it is possible my poor father wandered into town,"
mused Dick. "Perhaps he did that and was locked up by the police.
He is&#8212;well, you know he gets strange spells," and the youth's
face flushed.</p>
<p>"Run into town, lad, and make a search," answered the boomer.
"If I and Rasco get the chance we'll follow. We shan't strike camp
for several hours yet."</p>
<p>Dick thought this good advice and was soon on his way. The rain
had stopped entirely and the sun was just peeping up over the
distant plains when he entered Arkansas City and began his
hunt.</p>
<p>A visit to the police station speedily revealed the fact that
nothing was known there concerning his missing parent. Here Dick
left a description of his father, and was promised that if anything
was discovered of the man word would be sent to him
immediately.</p>
<p>Having ridden around to the depot, hotels and other public
places, Dick tied up his steed and began a hunt through the various
streets, looking into the doors of the stores and saloons as he
passed.</p>
<p>His footsteps soon brought him down to the vicinity of the river
front. Here, situated along several blocks, were a number of eating
and drinking houses, patronized principally by river men, gamblers
and similar persons.</p>
<p>Having satisfied himself, with a sigh of relief, that his father
was not in any of the saloons, the youth came to a halt in front of
a restaurant. He had not eaten anything since the evening before,
and his night of adventures had made him decidedly hungry.</p>
<p>"I'll get a cup of coffee and some rolls to brace me up," he
thought, and entered the establishment. His order was soon given,
and he took a seat at a side table, close to a thin board
partition.</p>
<p>His order served, he was disposing of the last of it, when the
sound of voices on the other side of the partition attracted his
attention.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone, Juan Donomez!" came in the voice of a girl.
"You have no right to touch me."</p>
<p>"You are too pretty to be left alone," came in the slick tones
of a Mexican vaquero. "Come, now, senorita, give me just one
kiss."</p>
<p>"I will not, and you must leave me alone," went on the girl, and
her trembling voice showed plainly that she was much frightened.
"Where is the man who sent for me?"</p>
<p>"He is not here yet."</p>
<p>"I do not believe he sent for me at all. It was a trick of yours
to get me here. Let me go."</p>
<p>"Not yet, senorita; you can go after a while. But first you must
give me a kiss. Then I will explain why I had you come."</p>
<p>As the last words were uttered Dick heard a scurry of feet, then
came a faint scream, cut short by the Mexican. The boy waited to
hear no more.</p>
<p>"The contemptible greaser!" he muttered and leaped up. Throwing
down the amount of his check on the cashier's desk he hurried from
the restaurant. As he had supposed there was a hallway next door,
where the talking he had overheard was taking place.</p>
<p>"Oh, save me!" cried the girl, and one glance at her told Dick
that she was not over sixteen and as beautiful as any maiden he had
ever seen. She was attired in true western style and wore on her
mass of shining curls a big, soft riding hat.</p>
<p>"Let that young lady alone," cried the youth to the Mexican, who
glared at him savagely. "I overheard your talk, and if she wants to
leave she shall do it."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you for coming to my aid," burst out the girl
gratefully. "This bad man&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Say no more, Nellie Winthrop," interrupted the Mexican. "Go to
the rear. I will attend to this cub who dares to interfere with my
business."</p>
<p>And he shoved the girl behind him. His roughness made Dick's
blood boil over, and, rushing forward, he put out his foot, gave a
push, and Juan Donomez measured his length upon the floor.</p>
<p>During the encounter Nellie Winthrop had escaped to the front
end of the hallway, and here Dick now joined her.</p>
<p>"We might as well go," said the youth.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; let us get out as quickly as we can," answered the
girl trembling. "He may attempt to attack you."</p>
<p>"I ought to hand him over to the authorities, but I won't," said
Dick. "Come," and he opened the door and followed her to the
street.</p>
<p>"I shall never forget you for your kindness," the girl burst out
as soon as they had left the vicinity of the spot where the trouble
had occurred. "You are very brave, Mr.&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I'm only Dick Arbuckle, Miss&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Nellie Winthrop is my name. I just reached Arkansas City
yesterday. I am from Peoria, and am looking for my uncle, who is
somewhere among the Oklahoma boomers."</p>
<p>"Indeed! I'm one of the boomers myself&#8212;at least, I've been
with them a good part of the time. Perhaps I know your uncle. What
is his name?"</p>
<p>"John Rasco, but I believe the men all call him Jack Rasco."</p>
<p>"Why, is it possible! I know Jack Rasco well&#8212;in fact, my
father and I have been stopping with him ever since we came on from
New York. As soon as the rush into Oklahoma was over my father was
going to get your uncle to locate a certain mine claim in the West
for him&#8212;a claim that belongs to us, but which can't be
located very easily, it seems."</p>
<p>"And where is my uncle now?" demanded Nellie Winthrop.</p>
<p>"At the boomers' camp, I suppose. You see," went on Dick, his
face falling, "there is something wrong afoot." And in a few words
he told of his father's disappearance and of the search being made
to find him.</p>
<p>"I sincerely trust he is safe," said Nellie when he had
concluded. "I presume you want to resume your search. Do not let me
detain you. If you are among the boomers we will certainly meet
again," and she held out her hand.</p>
<p>"Do you feel safe enough to find the camp alone?" he asked.
"Perhaps I had better take you there. It is about a mile in that
direction," and he indicated the locality with a wave of his
hand.</p>
<p>"I feel safe enough in the open air," she smiled. "It was only
when that Mexican had me cornered in a dark hallway that I felt
alarmed. I was born and brought up on the plains, and I've been to
Peoria only to get educated, as they say. I've a horse at the
livery stable, and I can ride the distance."</p>
<p>"May I ask how you fell in with that greaser?"</p>
<p>"I think he overheard me asking for my uncle at the hotel, and
after that he sent a note saying my uncle was at the place where
you found me. I saw him first on the train, where he tried his best
to get some information from me about some horses. But I told him
little," concluded the girl.</p>
<p>Five minutes later they parted at the livery stable, where
Nellie had left her horse, and Dick went on his way to continue his
search for his lost parent. The girl had thanked him again for what
he had done and had squeezed his hand so warmly that his heart
thumped pretty hard, while his face was flushed more than ever
before.</p>
<hr width="30%" size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>OUT ON THE RIVER.</h3>
<p>For over half an hour longer Dick tramped the streets of the
city looking for some trace of his father.</p>
<p>Presently he found himself down by the docks along the muddy
river. The stream was much swollen, and the few boats tied up were
bumping freely against the shore as the current swung them in.</p>
<p>"I wonder if father could have come down here?" he mused. "He
had a great fondness for the water when he got those strange
spells."</p>
<p>Slowly and with eyes wide open he moved down the river shore,
ready to seize upon any evidence which might present itself.</p>
<p>Suddenly he uttered a cry and leaped down into a rowboat lying
before, him.</p>
<p>"Father's hat! I'd know it among a thousand!"</p>
<p>Dick was right. There on the stern seat of the craft rested the
head-covering Mortimer Arbuckle had worn ever since he had left New
York.</p>
<p>The tears stood in the youth's eyes as he picked up the hat and
inspected it. One side of the brim was covered with dirt, and it
was still soaked from the rain.</p>
<p>"Poor father! Is it possible he fell overboard?"</p>
<p>Dick said "fell overboard," but he thought something else. He
knew as well as anybody that his father did strange things while
under the influence of the melancholy spells which at times haunted
him.</p>
<p>He looked up and down the stream. Nothing was in sight but the
boats and here and there a mass of driftwood.</p>
<p>He sat down on the seat and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>"Say, boy, wot yer doin' in my boat?"</p>
<p>It was a burly fellow standing upon the shore who asked the
question.</p>
<p>"Excuse me; I am looking for my father, who is missing. I just
found his hat on the seat here. Did you see anything of him?"</p>
<p>"Missing, eh&#8212;an' thet's his headgear? Say, boy, thet's no
laughin' matter," and the burly fellow looked at the youth
kindly.</p>
<p>"I know it. I am afraid he tumbled overboard. He had times when
he wasn't feeling quite right in his head."</p>
<p>The burly individual whistled softly to himself. "Then I reckon
Sary was right, arter all," he half mused.</p>
<p>"Sary? Who do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Sary's my wife. She woke me up about five o'clock this mornin'.
We live up in the shanty yonder. Sary said she heard somebody
moanin' an' yellin' down here. I said she wuz dreamin', but I allow
now ez I might hev been mistook, eh?"</p>
<p>"You didn't come out to investigate?"</p>
<p>"No; it war too stormy. I listened, but there wuz no more of the
noise arter Sary waked me up. If yer father fell overboard I'm
mighty sorry fer yer. If he did go over his body must be a long way
down stream by this time."</p>
<p>"Poor father!" It was all Dick could say. He and his parent had
been alone in the wide world, and now to think that his only
relative was gone was almost beyond endurance.</p>
<p>"Take the boat and go down if yer want to," went on the burly
individual. "Ye can leave the craft at Woolley's mill. I'd go
along, only the old woman's took sick an' I've got to hustle fer a
doctor."</p>
<p>"I will take a look around in the boat," answered Dick, and,
having procured the oars, he set off. The current was so strong it
was not necessary to use the blades, and he had all he could do to
keep the craft from spinning around and dashing itself against the
shore or the other boats which lay along both banks.</p>
<p>On and on the rowboat sped, until about a quarter of a mile had
been covered. Nothing unusual had yet been noted, yet the boy kept
his eyes strained for some sign of his father, praying inwardly
that all might still be well with the only one who was left to
him.</p>
<p>"If father is dead, what shall I do?" he thought with a shiver.
"He had all of our money with him, all of those precious papers,
everything. I would be left a pauper, and, worse than that, without
a single relative in the wide world. Oh, pray Heaven he is spared
to me!"</p>
<p>"Look out there, youngster!"</p>
<p>It was a wild cry, coming from a bend in the stream. Dick had
been gazing across the river. Now he turned to behold his craft
rushing swiftly toward the trunk of a half-submerged tree which the
storm had torn away from the shore.</p>
<p>The river was almost a torrent at this place.</p>
<p>He grasped the oars, intending to turn the boat from its mad
course. But the action came too late. Crash! The craft struck a
sharp branch of the tree with fearful force, staving in the bow
completely, and the next instant the boy was hurled headlong into
the boiling and foaming current.</p>

<h3>EXPOSING A SWINDLER.</h3>
<p>It was less than an hour after separating from Dick Arbuckle
that Pawnee Brown found his way to Arkansas City.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by Jack Rasco and Cal Clemmer, and the great
scout's object was not alone to aid Dick in the search for Mortimer
Arbuckle, but also to help Cal Clemmer get back some money out of
which the cowboy boomer claimed he had been swindled.</p>
<p>Clemmer had played cards with a certain sharp known as Pete
Stillwater, and lost two hundred and fifty dollars. At first he had
imagined he had lost it fairly enough, but after thoughts, coupled
with what he heard on the sly the next day, made him certain that
Stillwater had cheated him.</p>
<p>He had brought his case to Pawnee Brown, and the leader of the
boomers at once concluded that the gambler had not acted fairly. He
had met Stillwater at Wichita, where the gambler's reputation was
far from savory.</p>
<p>"You were a fool to bet at cards, Cal," he said flatly. "But
that is no reason why Stillwater should cheat you. I'll do what I
can, but you must promise to leave playing for high stakes alone in
the future."</p>
<p>"Don't yer fear, Pawnee," was Clemmer's ready reply. "A scorched
Injun keeps hez distance from the blaze, don't he? Wall, I'm the
scorched Injun in this air case. Git back my money fer me an' I
won't play nothin' higher then penny-ante ez long ez I live."</p>
<p>The gambling resort at which Stillwater was holding forth was
soon reached, and the three entered, to find the place comfortably
crowded by boomers, men-about-town, cowboys and gamblers, all
anxious to add to their wealth without working. As Pawnee Brown
surveyed the assemblage his lip curled with a sarcasm which was by
no means displaced.</p>
<p>"Poor fools!" he thought; "they expect to win, and nine-tenths
of them are bound in the end to be fleeced out of all they possess.
Why men who have brains will throw away good money in this fashion
is more than I can understand."</p>
<p>"Thar's Stillwater," whispered Cal Clemmer. "Hang hez hide, I'd
like ter wring hez neck fer him."</p>
<p>"Better wring his money bag first," smiled Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>Without hesitation he called Stillwater outside and explained
the situation.</p>
<p>"You can say what you please, Stillwater," he said. "I am
certain you have been cheating, for I know your past record. You
must restore that money and do it right away."</p>
<p>A stormy war of words followed, but Pawnee Brown was firm and at
last Stillwater gave up about a hundred dollars&#8212;all he had
with him.</p>
<p>He went off vowing vengeance and when at a safe distance turned
and drew a pistol from his pocket.</p>
<p>"He's going to shoot ye!" cried one of the boomers, but
Stillwater was afraid to fire. As Pawnee Brown started after him on
a run the gambler fled toward the river.</p>
<p>"Let us go after him!" cried one of the others, and away they
went. Soon they came in sight of the river and saw Stillwater in a
small craft, sculling his way to the opposite shore. Presently a
bend in the stream hid him from view.</p>
<p>"Hullo!" sang out Pawnee Brown. "Here comes another rowboat,
and&#8212;yes, there is Dick Arbuckle in it. What can he be doing
on the river?"</p>
<p>"The boat is makin' fer thet half-sunk tree!" interrupted Cal
Clemmer. "He'll strike ef he don't look out! Heavens!"</p>
<p>"Look out there, youngster!" yelled Pawnee Brown, and those were
the words which attracted Dick's attention, as mentioned in the
former chapter.</p>
<p>It was useless to say more. Standing upon the bank, Pawnee Brown
and the cowboy boomer saw the craft strike and go to pieces and saw
Dick thrown out into the madly rushing current.</p>
<p>As the boy sped along his head came into painful contact with
the furthest of the tree branches, and he was partially stunned.
His eyes closed and he struck out wildly and ineffectually.</p>
<p>"He'll be drowned!" gasped Clemmer. "It would take a strong
swimmer to gain the bank with the water runnin' ez it is
to-day."</p>
<p>"I don't believe he could catch a rope," answered Pawnee Brown,
starting off down the river bank. "Cal, hunt one up somewhere; I'm
going in after him!"</p>
<p>"But the risk&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Never mind the risk. Get the rope if you can," and away went
the scout again.</p>
<p>"Help!" came faintly from Dick. He was dazed and weak, and could
hardly see in what direction the shore really was.</p>
<p>"Keep up, boy, and we'll save you!" shouted Pawnee Brown
encouragingly.</p>
<p>Reaching a spot twenty or thirty feet below where Dick was
drifting, he threw off his hat and coat and leaped into the
stream.</p>
<p>Down he went over his head, to come up a second later and strike
out powerfully for the youth. The cold water chilled him, but to
this he paid no attention. He had taken a fancy to Dick, and was
resolved to save the boy at any cost.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer he came. It was a tough struggle, for in the
bend of the swollen stream the water boiled and foamed upon all
sides. He was yet ten feet away from Dick, when he saw the youth
sink beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Gone!" he thought, and made a leap and a dive. His outstretched
hand came in contact with Dick's left arm, and he dragged his
burden upward.</p>
<p>"Keep cool, Dick," he said when he could speak. "Can't you
swim?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but not extra well," panted the half-drowned lad. "I
struck my head upon something."</p>
<p>"Then lay hold of my shoulder and I'll keep you up. Steady, now,
or the current will send us around like two tops."</p>
<p>No more was said, as both felt they must save their breath. With
Dick clinging loosely, so as not to hinder his swimming, Pawnee
Brown struck out for the shore.</p>
<p>It was perilous work, for other trees and obstructions were upon
every hand, and more than once both were torn and scratched as they
sped by in what was little short of a whirlpool.</p>
<p>"Catch the rope!" suddenly came from Clemmer, and a noose
whizzed in the air and fell close beside the pair. Both Pawnee
Brown and Dick did as requested, and the cowboy boomer began to
haul in with all the strength at his command. It was hard work, but
Clemmer was equal to it, and presently those in the water came
close enough to gain a footing, and then the peril was over.</p>
<p>Dick's story was soon told, to which the great scout added that
of his own.</p>
<p>"I shall not attempt to follow up Stillwater," Pawnee Brown
concluded. "It is high time I got back to camp, for let me tell
you, privately, we move westward to-day. You may continue the hunt
for your father or come with me, just as you choose. It is possible
you may find some trace of him around here, but it is doubtful to
me, after such a storm. It's hard lines, boy, but cheer up; things
may not be as bad as you imagine," and he laid a dripping but
affectionate arm upon Dick's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I will stay here for a while, at least," answered Dick.
"But&#8212;but I am without a cent, and&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"How much do you want, Dick?" and Pawnee Brown's pocketbook came
out without delay.</p>
<p>"If you will lend me ten dollars&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Here are twenty. When you want more let me know. Now, goodbye,
and good luck to you."</p>
<p>And the next minute Pawnee Brown and Clemmer were gone. Dick
watched them out of sight and a warm feeling went over his
heart.</p>
<p>"The major is as generous as he is brave," he murmured. "He is
one scout of a thousand. No wonder all the boomers asked him to
lead them in this expedition."</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Dick was drying himself at the fire in a house
near by. Hearing his tale of misfortune, the man who took him in
insisted upon treating him to some hot coffee, which did a good bit
toward making him feel once more like himself.</p>
<p>"It may be a wild-goose chase, but I can't give it up," he
muttered as he continued his search by walking along the river
bank. "Poor father, where can he be?"</p>
<p>The outskirts of the city had been left behind and he was making
his way through a tangle of brush and over shelving rocks. A bend
was passed and he gave a wild cry.</p>
<p>And small wonder. There on the river bank lay the motionless
form of his parent, dripping yet with the water of the river. The
eyes were closed as if in death. With a moan Dick threw himself
forward and caught one of the cold hands within his own. Then he
placed his ear to his parent's heart.</p>
<p>"Too late! He is gone!" he wailed. "Poor, poor father, dead
after all! Oh, if only I had died with you!" and he sank back
utterly overcome.</p>

<h3>MIKE AND THE MULES.</h3>
<p>"We move in an hour!"</p>
<p>This was the word which was whispered about the boomers' camp
shortly after Pawnee Brown's arrival.</p>
<p>The great scout had found it out of the question to attempt to
enter the Indian Territory in a direct route from Arkansas City.
The government troops were watching the trail, and the soldiers
were backed up by the cattle kings' helpers, who would do all in
their power to harass the pioneers and make them turn back.</p>
<p>Many a man would have gone ahead with a rush, but Pawnee Brown
knew better than to do this. If he was brave, he was also
cautious.</p>
<p>"A rush now would mean people killed, horses shot down or
poisoned, wagons ditched, harnesses cut up and a thousand and one
other disasters," he said. "We must beat the cattle kings at their
own game. We will move westward to Honnewell either this afternoon
or tonight. Get ready to go on whenever the signal is passed."</p>
<p>"But vot goot vill it do to vait by Honnvell?" questioned Carl
Humpendinck, a German boomer.</p>
<p>"We'll not wait very long there," answered Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>So the word went around that the boomers would move in an hour.
This was not actually true, but it was necessary to spread some
report of this kind in order to make the slow ones hustle. If left
to themselves these few would not have gotten ready in two
days.</p>
<p>"It's a move we are afther makin' at last, is it?" burst out
Rosy Delaney when Mike brought the news. "Sure, an' Oi'm ready,
Moike Delaney, but how are ye to git this wagon out av thet bog
hole, Oi dunno."</p>
<p>"Oi'll borry a horse," answered Mike. "It's Jack Rasco will lind
me the same."</p>
<p>Mike ran around to where Jack Rasco was in earnest conversation
with a stranger who had just come in from town. The stranger had
brought a letter from Nellie Winthrop, posted two days before, and
saying when she would arrive. The letter caused Rasco not a little
worry, as so far the girl had failed to appear.</p>
<p>"I haven't any horse to spare just now, Mike," he said; "but
hold on, you can have Billy, the mule, if you wish."</p>
<p>There was a little twinkle in his eyes as he spoke, but Mike
didn't see the twinkle and readily accepted the mule and led him
over to where his own turn-out stood.</p>
<p>"Moike Delaney, phot kind av a horse do yez call that?" demanded
Rosy.</p>
<p>"It's a mule, ye ignoramus," he answered. "An' a good puller,
I'll bet me whiskers. Just wait till Oi hitch him beside the
tame."</p>
<p>Billy was soon hitched up as Mike desired, and the Irishman
proceeded to urge him forward with his short whip.</p>
<p>It was then the fun began. Billy did not appreciate being called
upon to do extra work. Instead of pulling, he simply turned around,
tangling up and breaking the harness, and began to kick up the
black prairie dirt with both hind hoofs.</p>
<p>"Oh, the villain!" spluttered Rosy Delaney, who received the
first installment of dirt full in her eyes and mouth. "Moike
Delaney, ye made him do that a-purpose!" and she shook her fist at
her husband. "Ye bould, bad mon!"</p>
<p>"Oi did not," he ejaculated. "Git back there, ye baste!" he
added, and tried to hit Billy with his whip. The knowing mule
dodged and, turning swiftly, planted a hoof in Mike's stomach so
slickly that the Irishman went heels over head into a nearby
puddle.</p>
<p>A shout arose from those standing near.</p>
<p>"Score one round for the mule!"</p>
<p>"Mike, thet summersault war good enough fer a show. Better jine
the circus!"</p>
<p>"Oi'll show the mule!" yelled Mike, and rushed in again. But
once more Billy turned and got out of the way, and this time he
caught the seat of Mike's trousers between his teeth and lifted the
frightened man six feet from the ground.</p>
<p>"Don't! Let me down! Somebody save me!" yelled the terrorized
son of Erin. "Rosy! Clemmer! Rasco! Hit him! Shoot him! Make him
let go av me! Oi'll be kilt entoirely!"</p>
<p>Outsiders were too much amused to help Mike, but Rosy came to
the rescue with a woman's best weapon&#8212;a rolling-pin, one she
occasionally used in making pies for the family when in camp.
Whizz! came the rolling-pin through the air, hitting Billy on the
ear. The mule gave a short snort, broke what remained of the
harness and scampered off to make a complete circuit of the camp
and then fall into his regular place near Jack Rasco's
turn-out.</p>
<p>"Want him some more?" asked Jack, who had seen the fun, and was
compelled to laugh, in spite of his worry.</p>
<p>"Want him some more, is it?" growled Mike. "Not fer a thousand
dollars, Rasco! Yez kin kape the mule, an' be hanged to yez!" and
he stalked off to borrow a horse that was warranted to be gentle
under the most trying of circumstances.</p>
<p>In the meantime Pawnee Brown was completing his arrangements for
moving to Honnewell and then to enter the promised land by way of
Bitter Creek and the Secaspie River. Scouts sent out to watch had
reported that the cavalry were watching every movement closely, but
Pawnee Brown did not dream that Louis Vorlange had overheard what
was said at a meeting in the woods, or that this scoundrel had
hired Tucker, the cavalryman, to shoot down both himself and Dick
Arbuckle.</p>
<p>Presently Jack Rasco found his way to the scout's side.</p>
<p>"Pawnee, if you can spare a little time I would like your
advice," he said, and mentioned the letter from Nellie Winthrop.
"It's mighty strange the gal don't turn up, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps so; but she may have been detained," answered the
scout.</p>
<p>At this Rasco shook his head. The bearer of the letter had seen
Nellie's name on the hotel register. Something was wrong, he felt
sure of it. The letter had contained Nellie's photograph, and he
showed it to Pawnee Brown as he asked for permission to leave his
work of assisting the boomers to be prepared for a moving in order
to pay Arkansas City another visit.</p>
<p>"Go on, Jack. You're my right-hand man, but I'll manage somehow
without you," answered the great scout. "A pretty niece for any man
to have," and he handed back the photograph, after a somewhat close
inspection. Two minutes later found Jack Rasco on his way, to
encounter adventures of which he had never imagined.</p>
<p>"A note for you, Pawnee." It was one of the scouts sent out that
morning who spoke as he rode up. Pawnee Brown read the
communication with interest.</p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Come up to the ravine back of
Honnewell as soon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">as possible," ran the note. "I
think the cavalry are</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">up to some new dodge, or else the
cattle men are going</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">to play us foul. Urgent.</span>
<center>DAN
GILBERT."</center>
<br />
<p>"I must away, boys!" cried Pawnee Brown, tearing up the note.
"Be ready to move, but don't stir until you hear from me," and,
giving a few more instructions, he borrowed a fresh horse from Carl
Humpendinck and set off on a gallop of twelve miles across the
country.</p>
<p>As he covered mile after mile, through woods and over stretches
of broad prairie, he could not help but think of his racing mare,
Bonnie Bird. How she would have enjoyed this outing, and how she
would have covered this ground with her twinkling feet.</p>
<p>"I must find her and find the rascal who stole her!" he
muttered. "I wouldn't take twenty thousand dollars for Bonnie," and
he meant what he said. The little mare and the great scout were
almost inseparable.</p>
<p>The afternoon sun was sinking low when Pawnee Brown struck the
outskirts of Honnewell (spelled by some writers, Honeywell). Not
caring to be seen in that town by the government agents, who might
inform the cavalry that the boomers were moving in that direction,
the scout took to a side trail, leading directly for the ravine
mentioned in the letter.</p>
<p>Soon he was picking his way down a path covered with brush and
loose stones. Upon either side were woods, and so thick no sunlight
penetrated, making the spot gloomy and forbidding.</p>
<p>"Now, I suppose I'll have no picnic in finding Dan," he mused.
"I'll give the signal."</p>
<p>The shrill cry of a night bird rang out upon the air, and Pawnee
Brown listened attentively for a reply. None came, and he repeated
the cry, with the same result.</p>
<p>"I'll have to push on a bit further," he thought, and was just
about to urge forward his horse when a crashing on the opposite
side of the ravine caught his ear. Instinctively he withdrew to the
shelter of some brush to learn who the newcomer might be.</p>
<p>He was not kept long in waiting. The sounds came closer and
closer, and presently a tall Indian came into view, astride a
horse, and carrying an odd-looking burden in his arms.</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk!" almost burst from Pawnee Brown's lips. The Indian
he mentioned was a well-known chief, a warrior noted for his many
crimes, and a redskin whom the government agent had tried in vain
to subdue.</p>
<p>The scout crouched back still further and drew his pistol, for
he felt that Yellow Elk was on no lawful errand, and a meeting
would most likely mean a fight. Then he made a discovery of still
greater importance&#8212;to him.</p>
<p>"Bonnie Bird, as sure as shooting! So Yellow Elk is the horse
thief. The rascal! I've a good mind to shoot him down where he
sits!" He handled his pistol nervously. "What is that he is
carrying, wrapped up in his blanket? Ha!"</p>
<p>A murmur of amazement could not now be suppressed. In shifting
his burden from one shoulder to the other the Indian had allowed
the blanket to fall partly back, and there was now revealed to
Pawnee Brown the head and shoulders of a beautiful, but unconscious
white girl. Nor was that all. The girl was&#8212;Nellie
Winthrop!</p>

<h3>MR. ARBUCKLE'S STORY.</h3>
<p>"Father! father! speak to me! Tell me that you are not
dead!"</p>
<p>Over and over again did poor Dick repeat these words as he sat
by the side of that wet and motionless form on the muddy river
bank. The boy's heart seemed to be breaking.</p>
<p>But suddenly there came a change. He saw one of his father's
arms quiver. Then came a faint twitching of an eyelid.</p>
<p>"He is alive!" gasped Dick. The joy of the discovery nearly
paralyzed him. "Father! father!"</p>
<p>No answer came back, indeed, it was not to be expected. Kneeling
over his parent, Dick set to work to resuscitate the almost drowned
man.</p>
<p>Fortunately the youth had, during his school days in New York,
heard a lecture on what was best to do in just such a case, so he
did not labor in ignorance. His treatment was as skillful as memory
and his love for his parent could make it, and in less than half an
hour he had the satisfaction of seeing his father give a gasp and
open his eyes.</p>
<p>"Father, don't you know me?"</p>
<p>"Dick!" came the almost inaudible reply. "Where&#8212;where am
I?"</p>
<p>"You are safe, father. You fell into the river and came near to
drowning."</p>
<p>"Is that so? I did not know there was a river near here."</p>
<p>Mr. Arbuckle was silent for several minutes, during which Dick
continued his work and made him as comfortable as possible by
wrapping his parent in his own dry coat.</p>
<p>"Where is that rascal?"</p>
<p>"What rascal, father?"</p>
<p>"The man with the red mask&#8212;the fellow who struck me
down?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. So you were struck down? Where?"</p>
<p>"Just outside of the boomers' camp. Somebody brought me word
that Pawnee Brown wanted to see me privately. I went, and a rascal
rushed on me and demanded my private papers. I resisted and he
struck me down. I know no more than that," and Mr. Arbuckle gave
another gasp. His eyes were open, but in them was that uncertain
look which Dick had seen before, and which the lad so much
dreaded.</p>
<p>"Why, you were struck down last night, father, and several miles
from here. You must have come down to the river at a spot above
here. Don't you remember that?"</p>
<p>Mortimer Arbuckle tried to think, then shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>"It's all a blur, Dick. You know my head is not as strong as it
might be."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; and you must not try to think too far. So he got your
private papers?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The ones referring to that silver mine in Colorado?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and all of the others."</p>
<p>At this Dick could not help but groan. The papers were
gone&#8212;those precious documents by which he and his father had
hoped some day to become rich.</p>
<p>The history of the deeds to the silver mine was a curious one.
Two years before Mortimer Arbuckle had paid a visit to Creede,
Colorado, on business connected with a mining company then forming
under the laws of the State of New York.</p>
<p>While in Creede the man had materially assisted an old miner
named Burch, who was falling into the hands of a set of swindlers
headed by a rascal called Captain Mull.</p>
<p>Mortimer Arbuckle had never met Captain Mull, but he had saved
Burch's claim for him, for which the old miner was extremely
grateful.</p>
<p>Over a year later Burch had died and left with another old miner
the deeds to a new mine of great promise, deeds which had not yet
been recorded.</p>
<p>The old miner had forwarded these papers, along with others of
importance concerning the exact location of the claim, to Mortimer
Arbuckle, and the gentleman had then begun preparations to go to
the West and see if the claim was really as valuable as old Burch
had imagined.</p>
<p>Dick was just out of school, and would not think of remaining
behind, so it was arranged that father and son should go
together.</p>
<p>A spell of sickness had detained the father several months.
Before this, however, he had hired Jack Rasco to go to Creede with
him and assist in locating the new claim.</p>
<p>As Mortimer Arbuckle failed to come West, Jack Rasco returned to
the companionship of Pawnee Brown, for, as already stated, he
considered himself the great boomer's right-hand man.</p>
<p>At last Mortimer Arbuckle had come on with Dick, to find Rasco
had given his word to Pawnee Brown to stick with the boomers until
the desired entrance into Oklahoma was effected.</p>
<p>"Yer will hev ter wait, Mr. Arbuckle," Jack had said. "I'm
sorry, but I hev given my word ter Pawnee an' I wouldn't break it
fer a cool million, thet's me."</p>
<p>"Let us go with the boomers!" Dick had returned
enthusiastically. "It will be lots of fun, father, and it will give
you a chance to get back your health before you tie yourself down
to those silver mine schemes."</p>
<p>And rather against his wishes Mortimer Arbuckle had consented.
Dick saw his father was in no mental condition to locate claims,
form a new mining company, and do other labor of this sort, and
trusted that the days to be spent with the boomers would make him
much stronger in both body and mind.</p>
<p>"Do you think the robber thought of the deeds when he robbed
you?" went on Dick, after a pause.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I&#8212;don't know, Dick. It runs in my mind he spoke
of the deeds, but I can't remember for certain."</p>
<p>"He took your money?"</p>
<p>"Every cent." Mortimer Arbuckle gave a groan. "We are now out
here penniless, my son."</p>
<p>"No we are not, father. I asked Pawnee Brown for the loan of ten
dollars and he gave me twenty, and said I could have more if I
needed it."</p>
<p>"A good man&#8212;as generous as he is brave," murmured Mortimer
Arbuckle. "Would the world had more of such fellows."</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown and Jack Rasco are the best fellows in the world!"
answered the youth. "But, come, let me carry you to yonder house,
where you can get dry and also get something to eat."</p>
<p>He assisted his parent to his feet, then lifted the man to his
back and started off. A backwoodsman saw him coming, and ran to
meet him. Soon Mortimer Arbuckle was in the house and lying tucked
in on a warm couch.</p>
<p>A relapse followed, coming almost immediately after father and
son had exchanged stories and detail. In alarm Dick sent off the
backwoodsman for a doctor. The medical man was half an hour in
coming. After a thorough examination he looked grave.</p>
<p>"The man must be kept absolutely quiet," he said. "If you have
been talking to him it has done him more harm than good. You had
better go away and leave him among strangers."</p>
<p>In a further conversation Dick learned that the backwoodsman,
Peter Day, and his wife were ready to take charge of the invalid
for fair pay, and could be trusted to do their best, and it was
arranged to leave Mr. Arbuckle at the house, while Dick returned to
camp, hunted up Pawnee Brown and Jack Rasco and tried to get on the
track of the man of the red mask.</p>
<p>"And if I ever get hold of him I'll&#8212;I'll&#8212;mash him,"
said Dick, and the look on his youthful but stern face told that he
meant just what he said. The western idea of shooting had not yet
entered his mind, but woe to Louis Vorlange if his villainy was
once unmasked.</p>
<p>"Do not worry about me, father," said Dick taking his departure.
"I will take care of myself, and I am sure that either Pawnee
Brown, Jack Rasco or myself can get on the track of the rascal who
robbed and struck you down."</p>
<p>"Be cautious, Dick," murmured the sick man. "Be
cautious&#8212;for you are all the world to me!" and he kissed his
son affectionately.</p>
<p>"Who could have attacked father?" he murmured, half aloud. "It
was a dastardly thing to do. I must find out, even if I have to
remain in the city. But who knows but what it was one of the
boomers? Perhaps the man saw father had money and only asked about
his papers to put him off the track. As a rule, the boomers are as
honest as men can be, but there are several hang-dog faces among
them."</p>
<p>Dick had covered a distance of half a mile and was within sight
of the spot where he had been rescued by Pawnee Brown from a watery
grave, when a murmur of voices broke upon his ear, coming from a
thicket down by the river bank. The murmur grew louder and he
paused to listen.</p>
<p>Suddenly two pistol shots rang out, followed by a cry of pain
and rage. There was a brief silence, then came the words which made
Dick's heart almost stop beating:</p>
<p>"Now I'll fix you for helping to run me out of town, Jack Rasco!
I never forget my enemies!"</p>
<hr width="30%" size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE LETTER.</h3>
<p>To return to Pawnee Brown at the time when he made the double
discovery that Yellow Elk, the rascally Indian, was riding his
stolen mare, Bonnie Bird, and had as his fair captive Nellie
Winthrop, Jack Rasco's niece.</p>
<p>For the moment the great scout was nearly dum founded by the
revelation. He had not met Yellow Elk for several months, and had
imagined that the Indian chief was safe within the territorial
reservation allotted to him and his tribe.</p>
<p>As Yellow Elk shifted his fair burden, Nellie Winthrop's eyes
opened and she started up in alarm.</p>
<p>"Oh, you beast! Let me go!" she screamed faintly. She was about
to say more, but Yellow Elk clapped a dirty hand over her mouth and
silenced her.</p>
<p>"No speak more," he muttered in his broken English. "White girl
speak too much."</p>
<p>"But&#8212;but where are you taking me? This is not the boomers'
camp."</p>
<p>"We come to camp soon&#8212;girl in too much hurry," rejoined
the wily redskin.</p>
<p>"I was told the camp was but a short distance out of town."</p>
<p>"Camp he move. Pawnee Brown not safe near big town," went on
Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>"You're a good one for fairy tales," was the boomer's silent
comment. He had withdrawn to the shelter of the thick brush and sat
his steed like a statue, while his pistol was ready for use, with
his forefinger upon the trigger.</p>
<p>"But&#8212;but&#8212;what happened to me?" went on Nellie,
struggling to sit up, while Yellow Elk held her back.</p>
<p>"White girl lose breath and shut eyes," was the answer, meaning
that Nellie had fainted. "No more fight&#8212;Yellow Elk no hurt
her."</p>
<p>"I will go no further with you&#8212;I do not believe your
story!" cried Nellie. "Let me down."</p>
<p>At these words the face of the Indian chief grew dark, and he
muttered several words in his own language which Nellie did not
understand, but which Pawnee Brown made out to be that the White
Bird was too sweet to be lost so easily, he must take her to his
cave in the mountains.</p>
<p>"Will you?" murmured Pawnee Brown. "Well, maybe, but not if I
know it."</p>
<p>The mentioning of a cave in the mountains made Pawnee Brown
curious. Did Yellow Elk have such a hiding place? Where was it
located, and was the Indian chief its only user?</p>
<p>"Perhaps some more of these reds have broken loose," he thought.
"I would like to investigate. Who knows but what the cavalrymen are
after them and not the boomers, as Dan Gilbert imagined."</p>
<p>A brief consideration of the subject and his mind was made up.
So long as the Indian did not offer positive harm to Nellie
Winthrop he would not expose himself, but follow on behind, in hope
of locating the cave and learning more of Yellow Elk's intended
movements.</p>
<p>"Let me go, I say!" cried Nellie, but the Indian chief merely
shook his head.</p>
<p>"White girl be no fool. Indian friend; no hurt one hair of her
head. Soon we be in camp and she will see what a friend Yellow Elk
has been."</p>
<p>At this Nellie shook her head. That painted and dirty face was
far too repulsive to be trusted. But there was no help for it; the
Indian held her as in a vise, and she was forced to submit.</p>
<p>Moving along the trail, Indian and horse passed within a dozen
feet of where Pawnee Brown sat, still as silent as a block of
marble. It was a trying moment. What if the horse he rode should
make a noise, or if his own Bonnie Bird should instinctively
discover him and give the alarm?</p>
<p>"Poor Bonnie Bird, to have to carry a dirty redskin," thought
the boomer. The ears of the beautiful mare went up as she drew
close, and she appeared to hesitate. But Yellow Elk urged her along
by several punches in the ribs, and in a moment more the danger of
discovery just then was past.</p>
<p>On went the tall Indian along the ravine, peering cautiously
ahead, with one hand around Nellie's waist and the other holding
the reins and his pistol. He knew he was on a dangerous mission,
and he stood ready, if unmasked, to sell his worthless life
dearly.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown followed at a distance of a hundred feet, taking
care to pick his way so that his horse's hoofs should strike only
the dirt and soft moss, and that the brush growing among the tall
trees should screen him as much as possible.</p>
<p>Presently he saw the Indian halt and stare long and hard at a
tall pine growing in front of a large flat rock.</p>
<p>"Wonder if he has missed his way?" mused the scout, but a moment
later Yellow Elk proceeded onward, faster than ever.</p>
<p>Coming up to the pine, Pawnee Brown saw instantly what had
attracted the redskin's attention. There was a blaze on the tree
six inches square, and on the blaze was written in charcoal:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<center>10 f. E. D. G.</center>
</div>
<p>"Hullo, a message from Dan," he cried, half aloud. He had read
the strange marking without difficulty. It ran as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Ten feet east.</p>
<p class="author">DAN GILBERT."</p>
</div>
<p>Pacing off the ten feet in the direction indicated, Pawnee Brown
located a flat rock. Raising this, he uncovered a small, circular
hole, in the centre of which lay a leaf torn from a note book, on
which was written:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I write this to notify Pawnee Brown or any of my other friends
that I have gone up the ravine on the trail of half a dozen cavalry
scouts who are up here, not only to watch for boomers, but also to
try and locate several Indians who have left the reservation
without permission. I will be back soon.</p>
<p class="author">DAN GILBERT."</p>
</div>
<p>The boomer read the note with interest. Then he hastily
scribbled off the answer:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Have read the note that was left. Am following Yellow Elk, who
stole my mare and has Jack Rasco's niece a captive. Yellow Elk is
bound for some cave in the mountains.</p>
<p class="author">PAWNEE BROWN."</p>
</div>
<p>The answer finished, the boomer placed it in the hole, let back
the flat rock and wrote on the blaze of the tree, under Dan
Gilbert's initials:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<center>P. B.</center>

<h3>YELLOW ELK.</h3>
<p>The writing of the answer to Gilbert's communication had taken
several minutes, and now Yellow Elk was entirely out of sight. But
Pawnee Brown was certain of the trail the Indian had taken, and by
a little faster riding soon brought the rascal again into view.</p>
<p>Yellow Elk was now descending into a valley bound on the north
by a rolling hill and on the south by a cliff varying from twenty
to forty feet in height. Even at a distance Pawnee Brown could see
that the Indian was having considerable trouble with Nellie
Winthrop, who felt now assured that her first suspicions were
correct and that Yellow Elk had taken her far from the boomers'
camp.</p>
<p>"I will not go with you!" cried the girl, and did her best to
break from the warrior's grasp. But Yellow Elk's hold was a good
one, and she only succeeded in tearing her dress.</p>
<p>"We be dare in few minutes now," replied the redskin. "Den all
be right&#8212;you wait and see."</p>
<p>"I won't go with you&#8212;let me down!" screamed Nellie, but he
silenced her by a fierce gesture which made the boomer's blood
boil. It was only by the exercise of all his will power that the
great scout kept himself from shooting down Yellow Elk on the
spot.</p>
<p>The end of the long cliff was almost reached when the Indian
chief reined up the mare and sprang to the ground, still holding
Nellie tight. As he held the girl by the wrist with one hand he led
Bonnie Bird forward with the other. In a few seconds, girl, mare
and Indian had disappeared from view in the midst of a thick fringe
of bushes.</p>
<p>They had scarcely vanished when Pawnee Brown was on the ground
and had tethered his horse in a little grove of pines a hundred
feet away. This done, he stole forward to what he felt must be the
mouth of the cave Yellow Elk had mentioned.</p>
<p>The great scout knew he was on delicate and dangerous ground.
There was no telling how many Indians beside Yellow Elk there might
be in the vicinity, who had left the reservation without
permission; it was likely all who were there would be in war paint
ready to kill him on sight.</p>
<p>"The reds who train with Yellow Elk are not to be trusted," he
muttered. "Yellow Elk wouldn't like anything better than to scalp
me just for a taste of his old blood-thirsty days. Making a 'good
Indian' out of such a fellow is all nonsense&#8212;it simply can't
be done."</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown had dropped down in the long grass and was now
wiggling along like a snake through the bushes and between the
rocks. Soon the entrance to the cave was gained, hidden by more
bushes. He hesitated, looked to see that his pistol was all right,
shoved the bushes aside and slipped within.</p>
<p>It was so dark inside that for a moment he could distinguish
nothing. But his ears were on the alert and he heard the footsteps
of Yellow Elk resounding at a distance of fully fifty yards. He
could hear nothing of Nellie, and rightfully concluded that the
Indian had been compelled to pick her up and carry her.</p>
<p>An instant later he stumbled close to his mare. Bonnie Bird
recognized him with a snort of joy.</p>
<p>"Sh-sh!" he said softly, and the gentle animal understood and
made no further sound. But she gladly rubbed her soft nose up and
down his neck to signify her pleasure.</p>
<p>"Good Bonnie Bird," he whispered. "I'll be with you soon again,"
and went on after Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>The Indian had now come to a halt and was striking a match. Soon
some dry brush was set on fire and the redskin heaped upon it some
stout tree branches, for the air in the cave was chilly.</p>
<p>"Now me and white girl have long talk," said Yellow Elk, as he
motioned Nellie to a seat.</p>
<p>"Where is the boomers' camp?" she faltered, hardly knowing how
to answer him.</p>
<p>"Camp ten miles from here," came the short reply. "You here all
alone with Yellow Elk."</p>
<p>At this the frightened girl gave a scream of terror.</p>
<p>"You base wretch!" she sobbed. "Take me back at once."</p>
<p>"No take back&#8212;Yellow Elk no fool. White girl stay
here&#8212;make Yellow Elk good squaw, maybe," and he grinned into
her pretty face.</p>
<p>But now an interruption came which all but stunned Yellow Elk.
Leaping from his hiding place, Pawnee Brown pounced upon the
redskin, caught him by the throat and hurled him backward and
almost into the midst of the fire!</p>
<p>"You miserable dog!" came from the scout's lips.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, save me from that Indian!" came from Nellie, as she
quickly turned to the man she felt sure would assist her.</p>
<p>"I will, Miss Winthrop, don't fear," answered Pawnee Brown. "So,
Yellow Elk, we meet again. I reckon you remember the man who kicked
you all around the agency two years ago because you tried to steal
his new pair of boots?"</p>
<p>"Ugh!" grunted Yellow Elk. He had just managed to scramble out
of the fire, and was beating out the flames which had caught on a
fringe of his garments. "Pawnee Brown."</p>
<p>He muttered a fierce imprecation in his native tongue. Then,
before Pawnee Brown could stop him his pistol flashed in the
fire-light. He took aim at the scout's head and fired.</p>
<p>But though the action of the Indian chief was quick, the
movement of the boomer was quicker.</p>
<p>Many times had he been under fire, and he had learned to drop
when occasion required as rapidly as it could be done.</p>
<p>With the pressure upon the pistol trigger he went down like a
flash and the bullet intended for his head merely grazed the top of
his hat and flattened itself upon the cave wall opposite.</p>
<p>"Bah!" hissed Yellow Elk, when he saw how he had missed. He
attempted to take him once more, but now Pawnee Brown hurled
himself on the redskin, turning the barrel of the weapon aside, and
both went to the stone flooring with a crash. Nellie Winthrop let
out a shriek of terror.</p>
<p>"Do not let him shoot you! Make him throw the pistol away!" she
cried, as she wrung her hands. She would have liked to assist
Pawnee Brown, but could not see how it could just then be done.</p>
<hr width="30%" size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>NELLIE'S FLIGHT.</h3>
<p>Over and over on the stone flooring rolled the boomer and his
red enemy, now close to the fire and again off to one side, where
there was a slight hollow still wet from the recent storm.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown had Yellow Elk by the throat and across the back,
while the Indian held his antagonist by the shoulder with one hand,
while trying to beat his brains out with the pistol that was in the
other.</p>
<p>Once Yellow Elk succeeded in getting in a glancing blow, which
drew blood, but did no great harm. But now Pawnee Brown's grip was
tightening. The redskin was choking. His eyes bulged from their
sockets and his tongue hung out several inches.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" gasped the Indian chief. In vain he tried to shake off
that grip. It was like that of a bulldog and could not be loosened.
He struck out wildly, but the pistol butt only landed upon Pawnee
Brown's shoulder, a shoulder that was as tough as iron and could
stand any amount of pounding.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tactics of the Indian changed. Knowing that he was
in immediate danger of death by choking, and feeling how unlikely
it was that he could throw off his assailant, he let fall his
pistol and caught the boomer around the body. Then he began to roll
toward the fire, which was now blazing up more brightly than
ever.</p>
<p>The scout saw the redskin's intention instantly, but before he
could stop it both he and his enemy were close to the flames.</p>
<p>"Me die you die too!" hissed Yellow Elk, and gave another roll,
which took both himself and Pawnee Brown into the very edge of the
blaze.</p>
<p>"Take care! You will be burnt up!" cried Nellie Winthrop, and
gave a scream. Rushing forward, she caught Pawnee Brown by the arm
and attempted to draw him back.</p>
<p>But of this there was no need, for the great scout had already
changed his tactics, feeling convinced that to choke Yellow Elk was
now impossible. His hand left the redskin's throat, to double up
and sail forth into a crushing blow, which took the Indian chief
beneath the eyes and made him see more stars than were ever beheld
in the blue canopy of heaven. As Yellow Elk fell back Pawnee Brown
did likewise, but in a different direction.</p>
<p>The Indian was now in the midst of the flames and the cry he let
out was truly blood-curdling. Excited as he was, Pawnee Brown did
not let the intonation of that cry escape him. Understanding the
Indian language well, he knew it was more than a cry of terror or
pain, it was a call for help! Other Indians must be somewhere in
the vicinity.</p>
<p>"You had better run for it!" he said, turning to Nellie. "Mount
my horse&#8212;the mare the Indian had&#8212;and ride down the
ravine."</p>
<p>"Run?" she faltered.</p>
<p>"Yes, and hurry. Hark! As I thought! Other Indians are
coming!"</p>
<p>The boomer was right. The footsteps sounded from the opposite
end of the cave, which had two entrances, similar to each
other.</p>
<p>By this time Yellow Elk had rolled out of the fire and was
dancing around like a madman, trying to beat out the flames which
had communicated to his clothing.</p>
<p>As Nellie ran off, Pawnee Brown drew his pistol, resolved to not
only defend himself but cover the girl's retreat as well.</p>
<p>Little did he dream of the fresh perils which awaited Nellie.
What those perils were the immediate chapters which follow will
relate.</p>
<p>As Yellow Elk danced around, Pawnee Brown leveled his revolver
at him.</p>
<p>Crack! went the weapon and the Indian chief fell back with a
wound through his shoulder. The flickering of the fire-light had
saved him from death.</p>
<p>A cry that was little less than a war whoop now sounded out, and
with this four other Indians appeared, two whom Pawnee Brown had
before seen in Yellow Elk's company and two who were utter
strangers to him.</p>
<p>"Capture the white dog!" howled Yellow Elk, in his native
tongue. "Shoot the dog down!"</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" grunted one of the newcomers, and up went
several pistols. The scout fired at the same time, and one of the
strange Indians threw up his hands and fell lifeless. But the
bullet this Indian had sent on its mission struck the boomer across
the forehead and sent the scout to the flooring of the cave
senseless.</p>
<p>When Pawnee Brown came to a clear mind again he found himself
aching in every portion of his body, for in their usual custom the
Indians on finding him helpless had each taken their turn at
kicking him to suit their pleasure, Yellow Elk especially
delighting in this cruel performance.</p>
<p>The scout was bound tightly with a lariat which started from his
feet and was wound and crossed up to his very neck, making body,
legs and arms as stiff as those of an Egyptian mummy. He lay on the
cave flooring not a dozen feet from the fire, which Yellow Elk was
in the act of replenishing.</p>
<p>As he opened his eyes one of the other Indians, Spotted Nose by
name, stopped in front of him. The scout instantly closed his eyes
again, but it was too late.</p>
<p>"You all right," cried Spotted Nose, and gave him a sharp kick
in the side.</p>
<p>"Well I won't be if you keep on kicking me," replied the boomer,
as cheerfully as he could, although it must be admitted he was much
disturbed. He glanced around and was relieved to see that Nellie
was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Yellow Elk now came up and also kicked the prostrate scout.</p>
<p>"You heap dirty dog!" he exclaimed, his face full of bitter
hatred. "You shoot me&#8212;you die for dat."</p>
<p>"I suppose I will&#8212;if you have the saying of that, Yellow
Elk. But perhaps you won't dare to kill me."</p>
<p>"Why not Indian dare? Indian dare anything," growled Yellow
Elk.</p>
<p>"My friends are not far off&#8212;they will soon come here, and
if you harm me it will go hard with you."</p>
<p>At this all of the Indians laughed.</p>
<p>"No white man around here&#8212;we on guard all time," said
Spotted Nose.</p>
<p>"On guard, eh? And yet you didn't see me come in, Dirty
Nose?"</p>
<p>"Spotted Nose did see Pawnee Brown," was the answer; but this
was a falsehood. An Indian hates to admit that he has been in any
manner outwitted by a white man.</p>
<p>"You tell a good story, Dirty Nose." Pawnee Brown turned to
Yellow Elk. "Yellow, how did you run across that girl?"</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk no tell his secrets," came the answer. "Pawnee Brown
fool to ask. Pawnee Brown think him heap sly, like fox, but him sly
only like cow!" This produced another laugh, for the Indians from
the Indian Territory are not as stolid as were their forefathers,
and thoroughly enjoy their own rude manner of joking.</p>
<p>Presently Yellow Elk turned to his companions and spoke to them
in an undertone. A moment later he sped away, but whether in
pursuit of Nellie Winthrop or not, Pawnee Brown could not tell.</p>
<p>The Indian chief was gone fully an hour, and came back looking
unusually grave.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown had tried in vain to get Spotted Nose and the other
Indian to talk&#8212;to tell him why they had left the reservation.
Not one would speak further than to tell him to keep quiet.</p>
<p>On returning, Yellow Elk at once set to work to rig up an
upright pole from the floor to the ceiling of the cave, using a
heavy tree branch for the purpose. The upright was placed close to
where the smoke from the fire found a vent through several large
cracks in the ceiling, and the boomer watched these proceedings
with much alarm.</p>
<p>The Indians were erecting a fire-stake, such as they had used in
the wild west when some victim was to be roasted alive!</p>
<p>"Heavens! can that be meant for me?" was the question he asked
himself.</p>
<p>The stake planted and fastened firmly, Yellow Elk heaped some
fresh, dry brush around its bottom and then came up to Pawnee
Brown.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown see the fire-stake?" he asked, his savage eyes
gleaming like two stars.</p>
<p>"I do, Yellow. Who is it for?"</p>
<p>"Why does Pawnee Brown ask? Does he not deserve death?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I do&#8212;according to your notion."</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown shall burn&#8212;he shall burn slowly," went on
Yellow Elk, meaning that he would make the great scout's torture
last as long as possible.</p>
<p>"Your training on the reservation hasn't civilized you much,
Yellow, if that's the way you feel about it."</p>
<p>"I hate white man&#8212;all of them," grumbled the Indian chief.
"They take all my land away and put me in a little yard to live. I
would kill all white man if could," and he grated his teeth.</p>
<p>A moment later Yellow Elk nodded to the other Indians and all
leaped forward and bound Pawnee Brown fast to the fire-stake. This
done the redskins heaped the brush around the scout's feet.</p>
<p>"Now the dirty white dog can die!" hissed Yellow Elk, as he
advanced with a torch. "He can pray, but the white man's Great
Father cannot save him! He must burn until his bones are as
charcoal!"</p>
<p>And so speaking Yellow Elk thrust the torch into the dry brush
and set it on fire!</p>

<h3>DICK TO THE RESCUE.</h3>
<p>"That man is going to shoot Jack Rasco!"</p>
<p>Such was the thought which rushed into Dick Arbuckle's mind as
he heard the fatal words spoken in the woods near the river
bank.</p>
<p>He could not see either of the men, but he felt tolerably
certain in his mind that Rasco's assailant was Stillwater, the
gambler, who had been run out of Arkansas City by Pawnee Brown,
Rasco, Clemmer and a dozen others.</p>
<p>"Would you kill me?" came in Rasco's voice. The boomer was
concerned and was doing his best to gain time, in the hope that
something would turn up to his advantage.</p>
<p>"Kill you?" sneered Stillwater. "Do you think I'm going to put
up with the way I've been treated? Not much! I had a fine thing in
Arkansas City&#8212;something worth a thousand a week to me, and
you and your friends spoiled it all. I'm going to settle with you,
and after that I shall hunt up Pawnee Brown and the rest and settle
with them, also."</p>
<p>"You'll have your hands full a-settlin' with Pawnee."</p>
<p>"Bah! I am not afraid of him. He had me foul over to the Golden
Pick, but I'll be careful when next we meet. But I'll not waste
time with you here, Rasco. I've got you alone and 'dead men tell no
tales.'"</p>
<p>"Alone?" Jack Rasco began to smile. "You're mistaken. Look
behind you."</p>
<p>Stillwater started, but did not look back.</p>
<p>"That's an old dodge, Rasco, but you can't work it off on me. I
have you alone and I'm going to end the business right here."</p>
<p>"Not yet!" cried a youthful voice behind Stillwater, and crash!
down came a heavy stick, hitting the gambler squarely upon the head
and sending him with a thud to the earth.</p>
<p>As Stillwater went down, Rasco leaped forward and came down upon
him. But this movement was useless. The rascal was more than
three-quarters knocked out and lay for several minutes
helpless.</p>
<p>"I owe you one fer that, Dick Arbuckle!" cried Rasco,
gratefully. "Yer came in the nick o' time!" Now the peril was over
the boomer dropped back into his own peculiar manner of speech.</p>
<p>"I am glad I happened this way," returned Dick, as he drew a
long breath. "Gosh! what a lot of excitement we are passing through
out here! More than I experienced in all my life in New York."</p>
<p>"The West is the place fer stirrin' times, lad." Jack Rasco
turned to his prostrate foe. "Wall, Stillwater, do yer think it war
a trick now, tellin' yer ter look behind yer?"</p>
<p>The rascal answered with a groan.</p>
<p>"My head is split in two!" he cried. "Who struck me? What, that
boy? I'll remember you, youngster, and some day&#8212;&#8212;" He
did not finish.</p>
<p>"I ain't done with yer yet, Stillwater," said Rasco. "You war
goin' ter shoot me. I reckon turn about is fair play, ain't
it?"</p>
<p>"Would you&#8212;you shoot me&#8212;now?" faltered the card
sharp. At the bottom of his heart he was a coward.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't going to do it, Rasco&#8212;I was only&#8212;only
scaring you."</p>
<p>"Thet's a whopper&#8212;made outer the hull cloth, Stillwater.
Yer war going ter shoot me&#8212;an' I'm a-goin' ter be jess as
accommodatin'," and on the sly Rasco winked at Dick who was much
relieved to think the boomer did not really intend to carry out his
blood-thirsty design.</p>
<p>The face of Stillwater grew as white as a sheet and he trembled
from head to foot.</p>
<p>"Don't! don't you do it! Let me off, and I'll give you all the
money I have with me."</p>
<p>"It won't do, Stillwater."</p>
<p>"It's nearly a thousand dollars. Take every cent of it and let
me go!"</p>
<p>The gambler fairly grovelled at Jack Rasco's feet. His horror of
dying was something fearful to contemplate.</p>
<p>"I'll give yer one chance, Stillwater," said Rasco, in deep
disgust, and at once the rascal's face took on a look of hope. "Yer
ain't fit ter die, an' thet's why I say it. Promise ter let me an'
my friends alone in the future."</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>"Promise ter give up cheatin' at cards. If yer don't, some day
it will be the death of yer."</p>
<p>"I'll never cheat again."</p>
<p>"All right, I'll take yer at yer word. Now come on down to the
river."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"You hev got ter swim across to the other side whar yer belong.
Decent folks ain't a-goin' ter have yer over here."</p>
<p>Again Stillwater was much disturbed. But Jack Rasco was firm,
and soon the trio were down by the water's edge. Still pale, the
gambler plunged into the river and struck out for the opposite
shore. It was a hard battle against that current, but presently
Rasco and Dick saw him wade out at the other side. He shook his
fist at them savagely, then disappeared like a flash into the
woods.</p>
<p>"He'll not keep any of his promises," said Dick.</p>
<p>"Keep 'em? Yer didn't expect it o' thet viper, lad? No, he's an
enemy to the death. But whar did yer come from, and have yer found
out anything about yer poor father?"</p>
<p>Dick's story was soon told, to which Rasco listened with much
interest.</p>
<p>"I don't believe a boomer would rob yer father," said he,
reflectively. "Like as not it war somebody who followed yer from
New York&#8212;some man as knew the value of them air minin'
deeds."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll go back to camp and make a search, anyway, Rasco.
But what brought you here?"</p>
<p>"I'm lookin' fer my niece, Nellie Winthrop."</p>
<p>And Rasco told of the letter received and of how Nellie was
missing and no trace of her could be found anywhere. Dick was
almost as much disturbed as Rasco, for he still carried in his mind
a picture of the beautiful girl he had saved from Juan Donomez's
insults.</p>
<p>"Can the Mexican have waylaid her?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said the man of the plains. "But I've hunted the city
high and low."</p>
<p>A short while after the two found themselves in the town once
more. Nellie had put up at the Commercial Hotel, and to this
hostelry they made their way and entered the office.</p>
<p>"No news of the young lady," said the clerk in charge, who had
been interviewed before. "I am quite certain she started for the
boomers' camp on horseback."</p>
<p>Rasco heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>"Might as well go back," he said to Dick, then as he saw the boy
start he continued: "What's up? Do yer see anything of her?"</p>
<p>"No, Rasco. But look at that man, the fellow sitting down by the
corner table in the reading room, he with the brown hat."</p>
<p>"I see him. What of him?"</p>
<p>"He's from New York&#8212;a fellow who used to come sneaking
around father's office, trying to gather information about mining
shares."</p>
<p>"Gee shoo, Dick! Yer don't mean it!" Jack Rasco was all
attention instantly. "Maybe he's the rascal as knocked yer dad
over?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps. If I&#8212;There is a man joining him."</p>
<p>"I've seen thet chap afore. 'Pears ter me he works fer the
government."</p>
<p>"Do you know his name?"</p>
<p>"No. Wot's the other fellow's handle?"</p>
<p>"Dike Powell. He is known as a Wall street sharper. I wish I
could hear what the two have to say to each other. Yet I don't want
Dike Powell to see me."</p>
<p>"It's easy enough, lad. Thar's a window close to the table, an'
it's open. We'll walk out on the veranda, and get under the
opening. Come."</p>
<p>In a second more they were outside. Tiptoeing their way across
the veranda, which was deserted, they soon found themselves close
to the open window mentioned.</p>
<p>"And so that is settled," they heard the man from New York
remark. "I am glad to hear it, Vorlange."</p>
<p>Vorlange! Dick started and so did Jack Rasco. The boy was trying
to think where he had heard it before. Ah, he had it now. Many and
many a time had he heard his parent murmur that name in his sleep,
and the name was coupled with many other things, dreadful to
remember. Surely there was some awful mystery here. What made his
father mutter that name in his dreams, and why at such time was he
talking of murder and hanging, and sobbing that he was innocent? A
cold chill crept down the boy's backbone. Was the heart of that
secret to be laid bare at last?</p>
<hr width="30%"size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.</h3>
<p>"Yes, it's settled, Powell; and as soon as we are done here with
the boomers, I'll get to work and find out what the claim is
worth."</p>
<p>"How about being shadowed in the affair?"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid&#8212;I'm laying my plans too well," answered
Louis Vorlange. "I would go ahead at once, but to throw up my
position under the government just now might excite
suspicions."</p>
<p>"Have you the papers with you?"</p>
<p>"No; I left them at the cavalry camp. They are too valuable to
carry in one's coat pocket."</p>
<p>"Supposing the camp moves?"</p>
<p>"I have my belongings secreted in a nearby cave where they are
as safe as in a deposit vault of a bank."</p>
<p>"Well, Vorlange, what am I to do now I am out here?"</p>
<p>"Remain in Arkansas City for the present and take it easy."</p>
<p>"You promised me a hundred dollars on my arrival."</p>
<p>"And there it is."</p>
<p>There was the rustle of bank notes.</p>
<p>"New money, eh?" was Dike Powell's comment. "Been printing some
out here?"</p>
<p>"Not much. I know better than to go into the counterfeiting
business."</p>
<p>Dick clutched Rasco's arm. The youth's face was full of
concern.</p>
<p>"My father's money was in new bills," he whispered into his
companion's ear. Rasco nodded, but quickly motioned for
silence.</p>
<p>"I reckon this is drinks on me," said Powell, arising. "Come
down to the bar before you go back to the cavalry camp."</p>
<p>"I'm in a hurry, Powell, but I'll take one glass," concluded
Louis Vorlange, and the two men hurried from the reading-room.</p>
<p>"He is the man&#8212;I feel certain of it!" burst from Dick's
lips, when he felt safe to speak. "Rasco, there is some mystery
here. My father&#8212;&#8212;" He stopped short and bit his
lip.</p>
<p>"I know wot's in yer mind, Dick. I've heard yer father go on in
his sleep, and war talkin' ter Pawnee Brown about it. An' Pawnee
knows this air Vorlange. The two air enemies from school days.
Pawnee said Vorlange wasn't squar nohow!"</p>
<p>"He is evidently in the employ of the government."</p>
<p>"Yes; a land-office spy, now workin' ag'in the boomers fer the
cavalry as intends ter keep us out of Oklahoma."</p>
<p>"It will be hard to bring such a man to justice, without some
direct evidence against him, Rasco."</p>
<p>"Don't yer try ter do it&#8212;yet, lad. Take my advice an'
watch him. An' afore yer come down on him yer hed better question
yer father about Vorlange."</p>
<p>At this Dick winced.</p>
<p>"Rasco, my father's manner is against him&#8212;I know that. But
I'm certain he never committed a crime in his life."</p>
<p>"I believes yer, Dick. Yer father's a gentleman, every inch o'
him; I seed thet the fust I clapped eyes on him. But knowin' the
truth is one thing an' provin' it is another, especially in the
wild west. This air Vorlange may hev yer father in a mighty tight
hole, and if you show him up as the thief who stole the deeds an'
the money, he may turn on yer dad and squeeze him mightily,
see?"</p>
<p>"I see. But what shall I do just now?"</p>
<p>"Follow Vorlange and spy on to him all yer can. It ain't no ust
ter hurry matters, with your father flat on his back. Powell will
remain here and Vorlange will be with the cavalry, so yer will know
whar ter clap eyes on ter both of 'em if it's necessary."</p>
<p>A moment's reflection convinced Dick that this was sound advice,
and he said he would follow it, mentally resolved not to accuse
Vorlange of anything until he had gotten his parent to confess to
the true state of affairs.</p>
<p>By this time the boy and the man of the plains had left the
veranda and walked around to where Rasco had left his horse. A
moment later they saw Louis Vorlange hurry from the barroom of the
hotel, leap upon his own animal, and strike out of town in a
westerly direction.</p>
<p>"If I had a horse I'd follow him," began Dick, when Rasco
motioned the youth to hop up behind. Soon they were riding after
Vorlange, but not close enough to allow the spy to imagine that he
was being followed.</p>
<p>"If you go after him you'll get no chance to hunt up your
niece," began Dick, when the city was left behind.</p>
<p>"That's true, lad." Jack Rasco's face grew troubled. "I don't
know wot's best ter do. It ain't fair ter let yer follow Vorlange
alone; an' with only one hoss&#8212;&#8212;hullo, wot does this
mean? Carl Humpendinck, an' wavin' his hand to us like he war
crazy."</p>
<p>Rasco had discovered the German boomer sweeping up a side trail.
Humpendinck had made out Rasco but a second before and now shouted
for the man of the plains to halt.</p>
<p>"What is it, Dutchy?" called out Rasco, when they were within
speaking distance.</p>
<p>"Vot ist it? Donner und blitzen, Rasco, it vos der vorst news
vot efer you heard!" burst from Carl Humpendinck's lips. "I chust
here him apout quarter of an hour ago, und I ride der horse's legs
off ter told yer."</p>
<p>"But what is it&#8212;out with it?"</p>
<p>"It's apout dot girl you vos lookin' for. Rosy Delaney, dot
Irish vomans vot haf such a long tongue got, she tole me der
sthory. Gott im himmel! it vos dreadful!"</p>
<p>"But tell me what it is, Dutchy!" exploded Rasco. "Wot is
dreadful?"</p>
<p>"Der sthory she tole&#8212;I can's most believe him."</p>
<p>"See here, out with the whole thing, or I'll swat yer one on the
cocoanut, Humpendinck!" roared Rasco. "Yer as long-winded ez a mule
thet's gone blind."</p>
<p>"Gracious, Rasco, you vouldn't hit me, afther I ride me dree
miles und more ter tole you?" wailed the German, reproachfully. "I
dink me you vos mine pest friend, next to Pawnee Prown, ain't
it?"</p>
<p>"There'll be a dead Dutchman here in another minute if yer don't
open up clear down ter the bottom!" howled Rasco, who had never
before suffered such exasperation.</p>
<p>"Tell us the exact trouble," put in Dick, calmly. He saw that
exciting Humpendinck still more would do no good.</p>
<p>"Der Indian haf carried dot girl avay!" exploded
Humpendinck.</p>
<p>"Carried the girl away!" ejaculated Dick.</p>
<p>"My Nellie?" yelled Rasco.</p>
<p>"Dot's it, Rasco. Ain't it awful! Dot Irish vomans seen dot
Indian mit dot girl in his arms, flying der trail ofer like a biece
of baber pefore a cyclone alretty!"</p>
<p>"Humpendinck, are you telling the truth?"</p>
<p>"I vos tole you vot dot Irish vomans tole me. Mike Delaney und
dree udder mans vos lookin' for you."</p>
<p>On the instant Louis Vorlange was forgotten, not only by Rasco,
but also by Dick. It made both shudder to think that Nellie had
been carried off by a redskin. They turned into the trail from
which Humpendinck had emerged, and were soon on their way to the
camp.</p>
<p>Here Rosy Delaney was found very much disturbed. She came up to
Rasco wringing her hands.</p>
<p>"To think o' the red rascal a-takin' thet young leddy off!" she
cried. "I know her by thet photygraph! Och, the villain! An' it
moight have been Rosy Delaney, bad cess to him!"</p>
<p>"Show me the exact trail he followed," said Rasco, and this the
Irish woman did willingly. Soon Rasco was tearing over the prairie,
followed by Humpendinck, Delaney, Clemmer and by Dick, who borrowed
a horse from another boomer.</p>
<p>The trail left by Yellow Elk was easily followed to the vicinity
of Honnewell, but here it led away to the southwest and was
swallowed up among the bushes and rocks leading down into the
ravine previously mentioned.</p>
<p>"Oi reckon thot's the trail," said Delaney, after an
examination.</p>
<p>"And I vos dink dot ist der trail," put in Humpendinck.</p>
<p>"An' I calkerlate this is the trail," added Cal Clemmer.</p>
<p>Each pointed in a different direction, while Rasco and Dick were
of the opinion that none of them were right and that the trail led
up the ravine, just as it really did.</p>
<p>An interruption now occurred. There was a stir in the bushes
above their heads, and an elderly scout peered down upon them,
rifle in hand.</p>
<p>"Hullo, Jack Rasco, wot's the best word? Whar is Pawnee
Brown?"</p>
<p>"Dan Gilbert!" cried Rasco. "Come down, Pawnee ought to be
somewhere about here."</p>
<p>In a moment more Dan Gilbert, a heavy-set, pleasant-looking
frontiersman, stood among them. A hasty consultation immediately
followed. Dan Gilbert was on his way back to where he had left the
blaze on the tree, and it was decided that Rasco and Dick should
accompany him, while Clemmer, Delaney and Humpendinck went to
reconnoitre in the opposite direction. A double pistol shot from
either party was to bring the other to its aid.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes the first party was on its way to the
blazed tree. Dan Gilbert feeling certain that if Pawnee Brown had
passed that way he must have seen the sign and left word of his
own.</p>
<p>"If Pawnee was down here you can bet he spotted that Injun if he
came within a hundred yards of him," said Gilbert. "He can smell a
red like a cat can smell a rat."</p>
<p>The tree reached, the frontiersman threw back the flat rock and
brought forth the message left by the great scout. He read it
aloud.</p>
<p>"Following Yellow Elk!" cried Jack Rasco. "I know the rascal!
And it was he as stole my gal! Jess wait till I git my hand on his
windpipe, thet's all! Whar's thet cave, Gilbert?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but it must be somewhere up the ravine. Come
on."</p>
<p>And away went the trio, on the hunt for Yellow Elk, Pawnee Brown
and poor Nellie Winthrop.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>ATTACKED BY A WILDCAT.</h3>
<p>"You fiend!"</p>
<p>This was all Pawnee Brown could say, as with a face full of
bitter hatred Yellow Elk advanced and applied the torch to the dry
brush which encircled his feet.</p>
<p>In vain the great scout endeavored to wrench himself free from
the fire-stake. Yellow Elk and his followers had done their work
well and he was held as in a vise.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown shall burn slowly," said the Indian chief, hoping
to make the scout show the white feather. "Yellow Elk will watch
that the fire does not mount to his body too quickly."</p>
<p>"If you want to kill me why don't you put a bullet through my
heart and have done with it," said the boomer as coolly as he
could. The fire was now burning around his feet and ankles and the
pain was increasing with every second of time.</p>
<p>"White man shall learn what it is to suffer," said Spotted Nose.
"He killed my friend, the Little Mule."</p>
<p>"Your friend tried to take my life."</p>
<p>"Bah! say no more but burn! burn!" hissed Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>And with a stick he shoved the flaming brush closer in around
the scout's legs.</p>
<p>It was a fearful moment&#8212;a moment in which Pawnee Brown's
life hung by a single thread. The flames were leaping up all around
him. He closed his eyes and half murmured a prayer for divine
aid.</p>
<p>Crack! bang! crack! Two pistol shots and the report of a rifle
echoed throughout the cave, and as Pawnee Brown opened his eyes in
astonishment Spotted Nose threw up his arms and fell forward in the
flames at his feet, dead! The Indian who had been with Spotted Nose
also went down, mortally wounded, while Yellow Elk was hit in the
left arm.</p>
<p>"Down with the reds!" came in the ringing voice of Jack Rasco,
and he appeared from out of a cloud of smoke, closely followed by
Dan Gilbert and Dick. "Pawnee! Am I in time? I hope ter Heaven I
am!"</p>
<p>"Jack!" cried the great scout. A slash of Rasco's hunting knife
and he was free. "Good for you!" and then Pawnee Brown had his
hands full for several minutes beating out the flames which had
ignited his boot soles and the bottoms of his trousers.</p>
<p>"We plugged the three of 'em," said Gilbert. "I knocked thet
one," and he pointed to the Indian who was breathing his last.</p>
<p>"I hit the Indian with the yellow plume," put in Dick, and he
could not help but shudder.</p>
<p>"That was Yellow Elk," said Rasco. "But whar is he now?"</p>
<p>All the white men turned quickly, looking up and down the cave.
It was useless. Yellow Elk had disappeared.</p>
<p>"He must not escape!" cried Pawnee Brown. "I have an account to
settle with him for starting that fire."</p>
<p>"But whar is Nellie?" asked Rasco, impatiently, looking around
with a falling face.</p>
<p>"She ran away when the other Indians came to Yellow Elk's
assistance," answered Pawnee Brown, and in a few hurried words he
told his story.</p>
<p>"Then she can't be far off."</p>
<p>"Let us hunt for her at once," cried Dick, and his enthusiasm
made the men laugh, at which the boy blushed furiously.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Dick, yer don't think no more of her nor I do,"
said Rasco. "Which way, Pawnee?"</p>
<p>"This way, boys." The scout turned to the Indian who had been
wounded. "Dead as a door nail. Pity it wasn't Yellow Elk."</p>
<p>"So say I," answered Rasco. "But we'll git him yet, mark my
words!"</p>
<p>With all possible speed they ran out of the cave and to the spot
where they had left their horses. Here a disagreeable surprise
awaited them. Every animal was gone, including the one Pawnee Brown
had ridden.</p>
<p>"More of Yellow Elk's work!" muttered the boomer. "I'll tell
you, men, that red is a corker, and as a dead Indian he couldn't be
beat."</p>
<p>"I declar' this most stumps me!" growled Dan Gilbert. "Here's
the trail plain enough, but it's all out of the question ter follow
on shank's own mare."</p>
<p>"Let us hunt up Clemmer and the others," suggested Jack
Rasco.</p>
<p>"We must be cautious&#8212;the cavalry may be somewhere in the
vicinity," added Pawnee Brown. "How the redskins escaped them is a
mystery to me."</p>
<p>"They are evidently as sly as their forefathers," said Dick.
"But, really, something ought to be done. If we&#8212;hullo,
there's a horse down in yonder clearing!"</p>
<p>"Bonnie Bird!" shouted Pawnee Brown, in great delight. It was
indeed the beautiful mare. A second cry and the steed came bounding
up to her master.</p>
<p>"Now I can follow even if the others can't," said the scout.
"Rasco, it's a pity you haven't a mount. It is no more than right
that you should follow up your niece. If you insist upon it I'll
let you have Bonnie Bird. I wonder if Nellie or the redskin had
her?"</p>
<p>"I won't take yer horse, Pawnee&#8212;it's askin' too much,"
answered Rasco. "Supposin' we both mount her? If Bonnie Bird got
away from Yellow Elk it's more'n likely one of the other hosses got
away, too."</p>
<p>"That's so. Well, get up, Jack, and let us lose no time."</p>
<p>Soon both men were mounted. A few words all around followed, and
it was agreed that Dick and Gilbert should try to hunt up Clemmer
and the others, and then away went Pawnee Brown and Rasco upon
Yellow Elk's trail.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jack Rasco uttered a cry.</p>
<p>"See, Pawnee, here's whar another of the hosses got away. Hang
me if I don't think it war my hoss, too!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and here is where the horse dropped into a walk," he
answered. "I don't believe he can be far off."</p>
<p>Without delay Rasco slid to the ground.</p>
<p>"I'll follow him up afoot," he declared. "I'm fresh and can run
it putty good. You go ahead with the regular trail."</p>
<p>The trail left by Yellow Elk ran down along the edge of the
stream for a distance of perhaps a hundred yards, then it came out
on a series of flat rocks and was lost to view.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown came to a halt. Had Yellow Elk crossed the stream,
or doubled on the trail and gone back?</p>
<p>Dismounting, he got down upon his hands and knees and examined
the last hoof-prints with extreme care.</p>
<p>The examination lasted for fully ten minutes. No white man could
follow a trail better than this leader of the boomers, yet for the
time being he was baffled.</p>
<p>Yellow Elk had led the horses into the water, but the trail did
not extend across the stream.</p>
<p>"He's an artful dodger!" mused Pawnee Brown, when of a sudden he
became silent.</p>
<p>A faint scratching, as of tree bark, had come to his ears. The
noise was but a short distance away.</p>
<p>"Some animal," he thought. "No human being would make such a
sound as that."</p>
<p>Another ten seconds of painful silence followed. The scratching
sound had just been resumed when Bonnie Bird wheeled about as if on
a pivot.</p>
<p>"Ha!"</p>
<p>The exclamation came from between Pawnee Brown's set teeth.
There, from between the branches of a tree just in front of him,
glared a pair of yellowish-green eyes.</p>
<p>The blazing optics belonged to a monstrous wildcat!</p>
<p>As quick as a flash Pawnee Brown raised his pistol and pulled
the trigger.</p>
<p>Crack! The wildcat was hit in the side. The shot was a glancing
one and did but little damage.</p>
<p>Whirr! down came the body straight for the boomer, landing half
upon his shoulder and half upon Bonnie Bird's mane.</p>
<p>The little mare was thoroughly frightened, and giving a snort
and a plunge she threw both rider and wildcat to the ground.</p>
<p>As Pawnee Brown went down he tried to push the monstrous cat
from him, but the beast had its claws fastened in the scout's
clothing and could not be shook off.</p>
<p>Crack! Again Pawnee Brown fired. The flash was almost directly
in the wildcat's face, and shot in the left forepaw the beast
uttered a fearful howl of pain and dropped back.</p>
<p>But only for an instant. The pain only increased its anger, and
with gleaming teeth it crouched down and made another spring, right
for the boomer's throat.</p>
<p>Crack! crack! twice again the pistol rang out. But the big cat
was now wary and both shots failed to take effect.</p>
<p>The pistol being now empty, Pawnee Brown hurled it at the
enraged beast, striking it in the nose and eliciting another scream
of rage.</p>
<p>Then, as the wildcat came on for a final attack, the scout
pulled out his hunting knife.</p>
<p>As the wildcat came down the hand holding the hunting knife was
raised, with the blade of the knife pointing upward.</p>
<p>A lightning-like swing and a thrust, and for one brief instant
the wildcat was poised in the air, upon the very blade of the long
knife.</p>
<p>The blow had been a true one, the knife point reaching the
beast's heart, and when the animal fell it rolled down among the
leaves, dead.</p>
<p>"By thunder! but that was something I hadn't bargained for!"
murmured the great scout, as he surveyed the carcass. "That's about
the biggest wildcat I ever saw. It's a good thing I didn't meet him
in the dark."</p>
<p>Wiping off his hunting knife, he restored it to his belt. Then
he picked up his pistol and started to reload it, at the same time
whistling for Bonnie Bird, who, he felt sure, must be close by.</p>
<p>As Pawnee Brown stood reloading the pistol and whistling for his
mare he did not notice a shadow behind him. Slowly but surely
someone was drawing closer to him. It was Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>The Indian chief was on foot. In his left hand he carried a
cocked revolver, in his right an old-time tomahawk, from which he
had refused to be parted when placed on the Indian reservation.</p>
<p>The redskin's face was full of the most bitter animosity it is
possible to imagine. The glare of wickedness in his eyes fairly put
the look that had lived in the wildcat's optics to shame. His snags
of yellow teeth were firmly set.</p>
<p>He was resolved to kill his enemy there and then. Pawnee Brown
should not again escape him.</p>
<hr width="30%"   size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE MEETING IN THE WOODS.</h3>
<p>After leaving Pawnee Brown, Jack Rasco followed the trail of his
horse through a small grove of trees and along the upper bank of
the very stream upon which the great scout encountered Yellow
Elk.</p>
<p>"Blamed ef he didn't go further nor I expected," muttered Rasco
to himself as he trudged along. But the hoof-prints were now
growing fresher and fresher, telling that the animal could not be
far off.</p>
<p>The woods passed, he began ascending a small hill. At the top of
this was a level patch, thickly overgrown with short brush.</p>
<p>He had just entered the brush when he heard a strange sound. He
listened intently.</p>
<p>"Thet's a hoss in pain," he said to himself. "Too bad if the
critter hez had a tumble an' broke a leg! If that's&#8212;&#8212;
By gum!"</p>
<p>Jack had stumbled upon a large opening directly in the midst of
the brush. Before he could turn back the very soil beneath his feet
gave way, and over and over he rolled down an incline of forty-five
degrees, to bring up at last at the edge of a pool of black water
and mud.</p>
<p>Fortunately he was not hurt, although the roll had dazed him and
cut short his wind. As soon as he could he leaped to his feet and
gazed around him.</p>
<p>The horse he had heard lay half in and half out of the mud. Its
leg was caught between two rocks, and it was trying frantically to
free itself. It was his own beast, and at once recognized him.</p>
<p>"Whoa there!" cried Rasco, and did all he could to soothe the
animal. The horse appeared to understand that assistance was at
hand, and became quiet, while Rasco quickly released the locked leg
and the beast floundered up to a safe footing.</p>
<p>"Well, we're in a pocket, 'pears ter me," reflected the man of
the plains as he gazed about him. On three sides the walls of the
hole were very nearly perpendicular, on the fourth the slant was as
previously stated, but here the soil was spongy and
treacherous.</p>
<p>"Hang me ef I'm a-goin' ter stay here all day," muttered Rasco,
after a view of the situation. "Come, boy, it's up thet slope or
nuthin'," and he leaped on the horse's back and urged him forward
on a run.</p>
<p>Twice did the horse try to ascend to the plain above and fail.
Then Rasco urged him forward a third time. This time the beast
balked and away went the man of the plains over his head.</p>
<p>Fortunately Rasco landed in a tolerably soft spot, otherwise his
neck would surely have been broken. As it was, his head struck the
root of a fallen tree, which had once stood upon the edge of the
hole, and he rolled back near the pool all but senseless.</p>
<p>It was a quarter of an hour later before he felt like stirring
again.</p>
<p>"Hang the hoss!" he murmured half aloud, yet, all told, he did
not blame the animal so much for balking. "Couldn't do it, eh,
boy?" he said, and the beast shook his mane knowingly.</p>
<p>"Git along alone, then!" went on Rasco, and struck the horse on
the flank.</p>
<p>Away went the steed, and this time the top of the hole was
gained without much difficulty.</p>
<p>"Now you're out, how am I ter make it?"</p>
<p>It was easy to ask this question, but not so easy to answer it.
Rasco tried to run up the spongy incline and sank to his knees.</p>
<p>"Ain't no use; I'll try a new game," he growled.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rasco was in the habit of carrying, in cowboy
fashion, a lariat suspended from his belt. This he now unwound and
with a dexterous throw caught the outer loop over a sturdy bush
growing over one of the perpendicular sides of the opening.</p>
<p>Testing the lariat, to make certain it was firm, he began to
ascend hand over hand. This was no light task, yet it was speedily
accomplished, and with a sigh of relief he found himself safe once
more.</p>
<p>But in the meantime the horse had trotted off, alarmed by a
black snake in the long grass. Rasco saw this snake a minute later,
but the reptile slunk out of sight before he could get a chance to
dispatch it.</p>
<p>The trail of the horse led again back to the ravine, but not in
the direction of the cave. Bound to secure the animal before
rejoining Pawnee Brown, Rasco loped along in pursuit.</p>
<p>He was in the ravine, and had just caught sight of his steed
once more, when he heard several pistol shots coming from a
distance. These were the shots fired by Pawnee Brown at the
wildcat. He listened intently, but no more shots followed, and
being below the level of the surrounding country, he was unable to
locate the discharge of firearms.</p>
<p>"Something is wrong somewhar," he mused. "Can thet be Pawnee
shootin', or is it Dick an' the others?"</p>
<p>He secured the horse and began to ascend out of the ravine, when
a murmur of voices broke upon his ears. One of the voices sounded
familiar and he soon recognized it as that of Louis Vorlange.</p>
<p>Instantly dismounting, he tied his animal fast to a tree that
the creature might not wander away again, and worked his way
noiselessly through the brush. The voices came from a nearby
clearing, and approaching, Rasco saw on horseback Louis Vorlange
and half a dozen cavalrymen, among them Tucker, Ross and Skimmy,
the trio who had sought to detain Dick as a horse thief.</p>
<p>"I feel certain they will come this way," one of the strange
troopers was saying. "I saw at least two boomer spies along yonder
ravine."</p>
<p>"They will come to Honnewell," answered Vorlange. "It may be
that instead of making a rush they will try to sneak in during the
night, one at a time."</p>
<p>"We'll be ready for 'em," muttered Tucker. "I know my meat," he
added, significantly, to Vorlange, meaning that he had not
forgotten the reward offered if, in a battle he should lay Pawnee
Brown and Dick low. At the words Vorlange nodded.</p>
<p>"When will the reinforcements be up this way?" asked Ross.</p>
<p>"I have already sent word to headquarters," answered Vorlange.
"The lieutenant is sure to respond without delay."</p>
<p>"Do you reckon the boomers know we are on hand to stop them?"
questioned Skimmy.</p>
<p>"They know nothing," answered Vorlange. "If Pawnee Brown leads
his men in this direction they will fall directly into a
trap&#8212;if the lieutenant does as I have advised, and I think he
will."</p>
<p>"I hope the boomers start to fight and give us a chance to wipe
'em out," muttered Ross.</p>
<p>"There will be a fight started, don't you fear," answered
Vorlange.</p>
<p>The spy meant what he said. Too cowardly to meet Pawnee Brown
face to face, he wanted to make sure that the great scout should be
killed.</p>
<p>This would happen if a battle came off, for he felt sure Tucker
would do exactly as he promised.</p>
<p>Vorlange had determined to be on hand. Secreted in a tree or
elsewhere he could fire a dozen shots or so into the air, and this
would arouse both cavalrymen and boomers to think that actual
hostilities had already started, and then neither side would longer
hold off.</p>
<p>"When will the boomers move?" was one of the cavalryman's
questions.</p>
<p>"They are waiting for Pawnee Brown," said the spy.</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere about the country."</p>
<p>"Can he be up here?"</p>
<p>Vorlange started.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I think not.</p>
<p>"He's a slick one, Vorlange; remember that."</p>
<p>"I know it, but some men are slicker. Wait until this boom is
busted and you'll never hear of Pawnee Brown again."</p>
<p>So the talk ran on. Rasco listened with much interest,
forgetting the fact that he had promised to follow Pawnee Brown as
soon as the stray-away horse was secured.</p>
<p>What he had heard surprised him greatly.</p>
<p>Many of the plans of the boomers, made in such secrecy, were
known to the government authorities. The plan to move westward to
Honnewell was known, and a passage through to Oklahoma from that
direction was, consequently, out of the question.</p>
<p>"The boys must know of this," thought Rasco. "I must tell
Clemmer and Gilbert before I try to hunt up Pawnee again, or go
after Nellie. If there was a fight as Vorlange seems to think,
there might be a hundred or more killed."</p>
<p>Having overheard all that he deemed necessary, the man of the
plains started to retreat.</p>
<p>He had taken but a few steps when he found himself cut off from
his horse.</p>
<p>Three additional cavalrymen were approaching from the
thicket.</p>
<p>"Here's a horse tied up!" cried one. "Boys, whose animal is
this?"</p>
<p>The call instantly attracted the attention of Vorlange and his
companions. They turned toward the speaker, and now there remained
nothing for Rasco to do but to run for it, and this he did at the
top of his speed.</p>
<p>As long as he could he kept out of sight behind the bushes. But
soon Tucker caught sight of him.</p>
<p>"Halt, or I'll fire!" came the command.</p>
<p>Tucker spoke first, and several others followed. As Rasco was
now in plain view, and as each of the enemy had a firearm of some
sort aimed at him, it would have been foolishness to have thus
courted death, and the man of the plains halted.</p>
<p>"It is Jack Rasco!" cried Vorlange. "Boys, this is Pawnee
Brown's right-hand man!"</p>
<p>"I know him!" growled Tucker. "Rasco, you're in a box now and
don't you forget it. You've been spying on us."</p>
<p>"Make him a prisoner," said another of the cavalrymen, an under
officer. "If he is a spy we'll have to take him back to the fort
and turn him over to the captain."</p>
<p>A minute later Jack Rasco found himself a close prisoner. It was
destined to be some time ere he again obtained his liberty. Thus
were his chances of helping Pawnee Brown cut off.</p>

XVIII.</h2>
<h3>A CRY FROM THE DARKNESS.</h3>
<p>Let us return to Pawnee Brown, who, totally unconscious of the
fact that Yellow Elk was creeping up behind him, stood beside the
body of the dead wildcat, re-loading the empty revolver.</p>
<p>One of the chambers of the firearm had been loaded, when
something about the pistol caused the great scout to examine it
more closely. As he was doing this Yellow Elk advanced to within
three feet of him and raised the tomahawk for the fatal blow.</p>
<p>At this terrible moment it must surely have been Providence
which interfered in the boomer's behalf, for, totally unconscious
of his peril, he would have done absolutely nothing to save
himself. He bent over the pistol more closely.</p>
<p>"That trigger seems to catch," he thought, and threw the weapon
up and fired it over his shoulder, just to test it.</p>
<p>The bullet did not pass within a yard of Yellow Elk, but the
movement came so unexpectedly that the Indian chief was taken
completely off his guard and dropped back as though actually shot.
His cry of astonishment and fear lasted longer than did the pistol
report, and Pawnee Brown swung around to confront him.</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk!" came from his lips, when whizz! the tomahawk left
the redskin's hand and came swirling through the air directly for
his head. He dropped like lightning, and the keen blade sank deeply
into the tree behind him.</p>
<p>"Wough!" grunted the Indian when he saw how he had missed his
mark. Then he leveled the pistol in his left hand at Pawnee Brown's
head.</p>
<p>The great scout felt his position was still a trying one. His
own shooter, though still in hand, was empty. He pointed it and
started to back away to the tree behind him.</p>
<p>"Stop, or I kill!" commanded Yellow Elk, but instead of
complying, the scout took a flying leap to a safe shelter. Seeing
this, Yellow Elk also lost no time in getting behind cover.</p>
<p>With the pistol loaded once more the boomer felt safer. He
listened intently for some movement upon the part of his enemy, but
none came. The Indian is a great hand at playing a waiting game and
Yellow Elk was no exception to this rule.</p>
<p>"Well, if you can wait, so can I," thought Pawnee Brown and
settled down with eyes and ears on the alert. He thought of Nellie
Winthrop and of Rasco, and wondered what had become of uncle and
niece. He did not want to wait, feeling it was important to get
back to the boomers' camp, but there was no help for it, and he
remained where he was.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes went by and no sound broke the stillness saving
that of the water in the brook as it flowed down over a series of
rocks. Then came the faint crack of a single dry twig over upon his
left. He turned around and blazed away in that direction.</p>
<p>A fierce but suppressed exclamation in the Indian tongue
followed, showing that Yellow Elk had been hit. How serious the
Indian chief was injured there was no telling. It might be only a
flesh wound, it might have been fatal and Yellow Elk might have
died without further sound, and then again it might be only a ruse.
Again Pawnee Brown paused to listen.</p>
<p>Thus another quarter of an hour was wasted. It must be confessed
that the great scout's nerves were strung to the topmost tension.
At any moment a shot might come which would end his life. It was
ten times more trying than to stand up in line of battle, for the
enemy could not be seen.</p>
<p>Again came the crack of a twig, but very faint, showing that the
sound came from a distance. There followed a faint splash, some
distance up the stream. Yellow Elk was retreating.</p>
<p>"I reckon I hit him pretty bad," mused Pawnee Brown. "But I'll
go slow&#8212;it may be only a trick," and away he crawled as
silently as a snail along the brook's bank.</p>
<p>Inside of the next half hour he had covered a territory of many
yards on both sides of the brook. In one spot he had seen several
drops of blood and the finger marks of a bloody hand. Yellow Elk,
however, had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>"He is gone, and so is the trail," muttered the great scout at
last. He spoke the truth. Further following of the Indian chief was
just then out of the question.</p>
<p>"There is one thing to be thankful for," he mused. "I don't
believe he captured Nellie Winthrop again after he left the cave. I
wonder what has become of that girl?"</p>
<p>Bonnie Bird had wandered down the brook for a drink and
instantly returned at her master's call. With something of a sigh
at not having finished matters with Yellow Elk the boomer leaped
once again into the saddle and turned back in the direction from
whence he had come.</p>
<p>It was now growing dark, and the great scout felt that he must
ere long return to the boomers' camp and give the order necessary
to start the long wagon train on its way westward to Honnewell.
Little did he dream of what the government spy and the cavalrymen
had discovered and how Jack Rasco had been taken prisoner.</p>
<p>"Pawnee!"</p>
<p>It was a cry from a patch of woods to the northward, and
straining his eyes he saw Cal Clemmer waving his sombrero toward
him. Scout and cowboy boomer were soon together.</p>
<p>"Well, whar's Rasco and the gal?" were Clemmer's first
words.</p>
<p>"Both gone&#8212;I don't know where, Cal. Where are the other
boys?"</p>
<p>"Started back toward Honnewell; thet is, all but Dick Arbuckle.
He's over ter yonder spring gittin' a drink o' water."</p>
<p>"I am sorry I failed to find the girl," said Pawnee Brown. "She
must have wandered off in the woods and got lost. I am quite
certain the Indians did not spot her again."</p>
<p>"And Jack?"</p>
<p>"Went off after his horse."</p>
<p>"Wot do yer advise us ter do&#8212;stay here?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid staying here will do no good, Cal. I must get back
to camp and start the wagons up. I know they won't move a step
unless I am personally there to give directions. The old boomers
are all afraid of being fooled by some trick of the soldiers."</p>
<p>"Thet's so. Wall, if yer want me ter stay here I'll
stay&#8212;otherwise I'll go back," concluded Clemmer.</p>
<p>Dick now came up, as anxious as Clemmer had been to know the
news. His face grew very sober when he heard that Nellie had not
been found.</p>
<p>"I wish I knew more of this territory&#8212;I'd go after her
myself," he said, earnestly. "I hope you won't abandon the
search?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, lad; that is not my style. But I must get back to the
camp first and start the train along. I'll be on this ground again
by midnight."</p>
<p>"Then why can't I stay here? I am not afraid."</p>
<p>"Alone?" ejaculated Clemmer.</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;if you want to join Pawnee."</p>
<p>"By gosh, but that boy's nervy fer a city chap!" cried the
cowboy boomer, in admiration.</p>
<p>"Well, you know there's a girl in this, Cal," rejoined Pawnee
Brown, dryly. "And I reckon she's a girl well worth going through
fire and water for."</p>
<p>At this Dick blushed.</p>
<p>"I want to find out about Rasco, too," he hastened to say. "You
know I was going through with him, and he was going to do some
business for my father, later on."</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for several minutes, and it was at
last decided that Dick should secrete himself in a thicket and
stand watch there or close by until he heard from Pawnee Brown
again.</p>
<p>"Be on your guard, boy, for enemies may be thick here," were the
boomer's last words of caution. "Don't uncover to anybody until you
are positive it is a friend."</p>
<p>"And here's a bite for yer," added Clemmer, handing out some
rations he carried in a haversack. "You'll get mighty hungry ere
the sun comes up again."</p>
<p>In a minute more the two horsemen were galloping away. Dick
watched them until they were lost to view, then dropped to a
sitting position on a flat rock in the centre of a clump of
trees.</p>
<p>The youth's heart beat rather strongly. He was not used to this
sort of thing. How different the prairies and woods were to the
city streets and buildings.</p>
<p>"Lonesome isn't a name for it," he mused. "Puts me in mind of
one vast cemetery&#8212;a gigantic Greenwood, only there aren't any
monuments. What is that?"</p>
<p>There was a flutter and a whirl, and Dick grasped his pistol
tighter. It was only a night-bird, starting up now that the sun was
beginning to set.</p>
<p>Soon the woods and the prairies began to grow dark. The sun was
lost to view behind tall trees which cast shadows of incalculable
length. It grew colder, too, and he buttoned his light coat tightly
about him.</p>
<p>To pass the time he began to eat some of the food left behind by
Clemmer. It was not particularly appetizing, and in the city Dick
might have passed it by for something better. But just then it
tasted "just boss," to use Dick's own words. A bracing air and
hunger are the best sauces in the world.</p>
<p>An hour had gone by, and all was dark, when Dick started up from
a reverie into which he had fallen. What was that which had reached
his ears from a distance? Was it a cry, or merely the moaning of
the rising wind?</p>
<p>He listened. No, it was not the wind&#8212;it was a cry&#8212;a
girl's voice&#8212;the voice of Nellie Winthrop!</p>
<p>"It is Nellie!" came from his set lips, and his face grew pale.
Again came the cry, but this time more faintly.</p>
<p>From what direction had that cry for help proceeded? In vain the
boy asked himself that question. He was not used to a life in the
open and the rising wind was very deceptive.</p>
<p>"I must find her!" he gasped, leaping from the rocks. "I shan't
remain here while she is in trouble."</p>
<p>He had no horse the men being unable to provide him with one
when they had come together, but for this he did not care. He was
resolved to aid the girl if such a thing were possible.</p>
<p>Away he went over the prairie at a rapid gait, in the direction
from whence he imagined the cry had proceeded. Two hundred yards
were covered and he came to a halt and listened. Not a sound broke
the stillness, although he fancied he heard the hoof-strokes of a
horse at a great distance.</p>
<p>Then he turned in another direction, and then another. It was
all to no purpose. No trace of the girl could be found. He gave a
groan.</p>
<p>"It's no use; she's gone and that is all there is to it. Poor
girl!"</p>
<p>With a sinking heart he set off to return to the spot from
whence he had come. He advanced a dozen steps, then halted and
stared about him.</p>
<p>Suddenly an awful truth burst upon him. He was lost among the
brush!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>NELLIE MEETS VORLANGE.</h3>
<p>What had that awful cry heard by Dick meant?</p>
<p>To learn the particulars, we must go back to the time when
Nellie Winthrop started to escape from the cave in the cliff.</p>
<p>The heart of the poor girl almost stopped beating as she saw
Pawnee Brown face about, ready to defend both her and himself from
any enemy who might appear to help Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>Urged by the great scout, she set off on a hasty run for the
mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>Before the entrance was gained she heard the crack of a pistol,
but whether fired by the boomer or an Indian she could not
tell.</p>
<p>"Heaven spare that brave man!" was the prayer which came to her
almost bloodless lips.</p>
<p>She looked around in vain for the horse spoken of by Pawnee
Brown. Not an animal was in sight. Then she remembered what the
scout had said about riding down the ravine, and she set off on
foot.</p>
<p>Not far from the mouth of the cave the ravine forked into two
branches, the smaller fork ending at the distance of quarter of a
mile in a cul de sac, or blind pocket. Not knowing she was making
any mistake, she entered this fork and kept on running, expecting
each instant to find Pawnee Brown coming up behind her.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, I can't be right!"</p>
<p>Such was the cry which escaped her when she came to a halt,
realizing she could go no further in that direction. On both sides
and in front arose a series of rocks, more or less steep, and
covered only with scrub brush, impossible to ascend.</p>
<p>She looked behind. No one was coming. All about her was as
silent as a tomb.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better go back," she mused, but the thought of
encountering an Indian made her shiver. In her life in the open she
had had many an encounter with a wild animal, but redskins were as
yet almost new to her, and her experience with the hideous Yellow
Elk had been one she did not care to repeat.</p>
<p>She had just turned to move back to the ravine proper, when a
sound among the rocks caused her to pause. She looked intently in
the direction, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>"Hullo, there, miss; what are you doing away out here?"</p>
<p>The cry came from the rocks on her right. Turning swiftly, she
saw an evil-looking man scowling down upon her from a small opening
under one of the rocky walls of the <i>cul de sac</i>. The man was
Louis Vorlange.</p>
<p>Nellie did not know the fellow; indeed she had never heard of
him. But there was that in the spy's manner which was not at all
reassuring as he leaped down to where she stood.</p>
<p>"I say, how did you come here?" went on Vorlange.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I just escaped from an Indian who carried me off from
Arkansas City," answered Nellie.</p>
<p>"An Indian! Who was it, do you know?"</p>
<p>"A fellow named Yellow Elk."</p>
<p>Vorlange uttered a low whistle.</p>
<p>"Where is he now?" he questioned.</p>
<p>"I left him back in yonder hills, in a cave."</p>
<p>Again the spy uttered a whistle, but whether of surprise or
dismay Nellie could not tell.</p>
<p>"Were you alone with Yellow Elk?"</p>
<p>"I was for a time. But a white man came to my aid and the two
had a fight."</p>
<p>"Who was the white man?"</p>
<p>Before she gave the matter a second thought, Nellie
answered:</p>
<p>"Mr. Pawnee Brown."</p>
<p>"Ha!" Vorlange's eyes gleamed, and the girl felt certain she had
made a mistake.</p>
<p>"Where is Pawnee Brown now?"</p>
<p>"I left him in the cave with the Indian. I expected him to
follow me."</p>
<p>"I see. And what may your name be?"</p>
<p>The man's words were fair enough, but Nellie did not like his
manner at all, so she turned upon him coldly.</p>
<p>"And what is your name, and who are you?"</p>
<p>"I am not here to answer questions, miss. I am a government
official, let that be enough for you to know."</p>
<p>As he spoke Louis Vorlange caught Nellie by the arm.</p>
<p>"Let go of me," cried the frightened girl, and attempted to pull
away, but Vorlange held her tight.</p>
<p>"You come along with me. No one, and especially Pawnee Brown,
has any right in this territory just now, and it is my business to
see that all such people are kept out. I presume you belong to that
crowd of boomers, since you say you were carried off from Arkansas
City?"</p>
<p>"I shall answer no more of your questions, sir. Let me go!"</p>
<p>"You'll come along with me," muttered Vorlange. "I take it you
know what the boomers intend to do, and, if that is so, your
information is just what the government wants."</p>
<p>So speaking he attempted to drag Nellie up the rocks to the
opening before mentioned. The girl resisted with all of her
strength, and Vorlange received a box on the left ear which made
that member of his body hum for a long time after.</p>
<p>"You little wretch!" he cried, as he caught her up in his arms.
"I will get square with you for that."</p>
<p>"You are no gentleman! Let me go!" replied Nellie. Then she
attempted to scream, but he promptly clapped his hand over her
mouth.</p>
<p>In another moment, despite her utmost struggles, he was carrying
her up to the opening. This spot once reached, he took her inside
and over to a well-like hole upon one side.</p>
<p>"Do you see that hole?" he said sternly. "I am going to put you
in that for the present, for safe keeping. I call it my prison
cell, and no cell could be better. It is not a cheerful place, but
you will be as safe there as in the best prison in Chicago or San
Francisco. I'll be back for you soon, and in the meantime you had
better make no attempt to escape, for at the mouth of this opening
is set a gun, with a wire attachment, which may blow you up."</p>
<p>This latter statement was a false one, but Vorlange rightfully
calculated that it would have its due effect upon the frightened
girl.</p>
<p>Having thus intimidated Nellie, Vorlange lowered her into the
opening in the rocks, which was about six feet in diameter and at
least ten feet deep. This done, he lit a lantern and hung it so
that its rays might shine down upon his captive.</p>
<p>"You won't feel so lonesome with the light," he said. "Now keep
quiet until I return. If you behave yourself you have nothing to
fear. I am a government officer and I am holding you as a prisoner
only until I can turn you over to the proper authorities."</p>
<p>"It is a&#8212;a queer proceeding," faltered Nellie. She could
hardly bring herself to believe the man.</p>
<p>"Out here we can't do things exactly as they are done in the big
cities," grinned Vorlange. "We are out here after the boomers just
now, and your being here with Pawnee Brown will rather go against
you. But keep quiet now until I return."</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the spy quirted the opening, leaving Nellie
alone. With hasty steps Vorlange made his way along the fork of the
ravine until the opening proper was reached. Here he settled
himself in a tree to watch for Pawnee Brown's possible coming. But,
as we know, the scout did not move in that direction.</p>
<p>For over two hours Nellie was left alone, a prey to the keenest
mental torture it is possible to imagine. As the day was drawing to
a close Vorlange appeared, a peculiar smile upon his face.</p>
<p>He had met the cavalrymen, and Jack Rasco had been captured as
previously described.</p>
<p>"Well, we are going to move now," he said to Nellie, and threw
down a rope that he might haul her up out of the hole.</p>
<p>"Where to?"</p>
<p>"You'll learn that later."</p>
<p>As she did not wish to remain in that damp spot longer, she
caught the rope and was drawn up. Then Vorlange took her outside
and sat her down before him on his horse, first, however, tying her
hands.</p>
<p>It was during the ride that followed that Dick heard her cry for
help and started to her rescue, only to miss her and get lost in
the brush.</p>
<p>A ride of half an hour brought the pair to the edge of a heavy
timber. Through this they picked their way, until a small clearing
was gained, where was located a low log cabin, containing two
rooms. The log cabin was not inhabited, and Vorlange pushed open
the door without ceremony.</p>
<p>"You'll stay here over night," he said, as he ushered Nellie
into the smaller room. "You can see this has been used for a prison
before, as all of the windows are nailed up. I don't believe you'll
try to escape anyway, for, let me warn you, it won't pay. Make
yourself as comfortable as you can, and in the morning we'll come
to an understanding. We've got another prisoner besides yourself,
and between the two of you I reckon we'll find out before long just
what the boomers are up to."</p>
<p>And with a dark look upon his face, Louis Vorlange stalked out
of the apartment, locking the door after him, and thus leaving
Nellie to her fate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>THE MOVING OF THE BOOMERS.</h3>
<p>"Pawnee Brown at last!"</p>
<p>The words came from one of the boomers, a fat but spry old chap
named Dunbar.</p>
<p>"Yes, Dunbar," answered the great scout. "Were you getting
anxious about me?"</p>
<p>"Well, just a trifle, Pawnee."</p>
<p>"The camp must move at once. Send the word around immediately,
Dunbar."</p>
<p>"Whar do we move to?"</p>
<p>"To Honnewell. As soon as all hands are at Honnewell I'll send
out further orders."</p>
<p>In less than half an hour the immense wagon train organized by
the boomers located in Kansas was on the way.</p>
<p>At the front rode Pawnee Brown, Clemmer and several others who
were personal friends of the scout.</p>
<p>It was a grand sight, this moving. To this day some of the
boomers say it was the grandest sight they ever beheld.</p>
<p>Every heart was full of hope. Past trials and hardships were
forgotten. The boomers were to enter the richest farming lands in
the States and there start life anew.</p>
<p>The movement was made in silence and in almost utter darkness.
Of course, it was impossible to hide the news from the citizens of
Arkansas City, but the train was well on its way before the news
had any chance of spreading.</p>
<p>At the time of which we write there were several trails to
Honnewell from Arkansas City. The regular road was a fair one in
good weather, but, after such a rain as had fallen, this trail was
hub-deep with mud in more than one spot.</p>
<p>"Oi'll not go thot trail," was Delaney's comment. "Oi'll take
the upper road."</p>
<p>"Thot's roight, Mike," put in Rosy, his wife. "It's not meself
as wants to stick fast in this black mud. Sure, and it's worse nor
the bogs of Erin!"</p>
<p>"Vot's dot road you vos speakin' apout alretty?" put in
Humpendinck, who had as heavy a wagon as anyone.</p>
<p>"It's a better road nor this, Humpy," replied Mike Delaney.
"Folly me an' we'll rach Honnewell afore enny of 'em, mark me
wurrud."</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Humpendinck followed Delaney on the upper
trail, and, seeing the two go off, half a dozen followed.</p>
<p>It was more than half an hour after before Pawnee Brown heard of
their departure.</p>
<p>The great scout was much disturbed.</p>
<p>"It's foolishness for them to start off on the upper trail," he
declared. "I went over it but a few days ago, and at Brown's
Crossing the road is all torn up by a freshet. Besides that, we
must keep together."</p>
<p>"Yer right thar, Pawnee," answered Clemmer. "Delaney ought to
know better. But yer can't tell the Irish anything."</p>
<p>"Humpendinck went with him," put in Dunbar, who had brought the
news.</p>
<p>"Both the Irishman and the German are smart enough in their
way," answered Pawnee Brown. "But they've made a mistake. Cal and
Dunbar, you continue at the head, and I'll ride across country and
head Delaney and his crowd back through the Allen trail. I'll
probably rejoin you just this side of Honnewell."</p>
<p>With this command, Pawnee Brown left the wagon train and plunged
off through the darkness alone.</p>
<p>He had been over that district many times and thought he knew
about every foot of the ground.</p>
<p>But for once the great scout was mistaken, and that mistake was
destined to bring him into serious difficulty.</p>
<p>About half a mile had been covered, and he was just approaching
a patch of small timber, when he noticed that Bonnie Bird began to
show signs of shyness. She did not refuse to go forward, but
evidently was proceeding against her will.</p>
<p>Quick to notice a change in the beautiful mare's mood, Pawnee
Brown spoke to her. She pawed the ground and tossed her head.</p>
<p>"What is it, Bonnie? Danger ahead?"</p>
<p>Again the mare pawed the ground. Feeling certain something was
wrong, Pawnee Brown stood up in his stirrups and looked about
him.</p>
<p>All was dark and silent upon every side. Overhead the faint
stars shed but an uncertain light.</p>
<p>"It's one too many for me, Bonnie," he mused. "Forward until the
danger becomes clearer."</p>
<p>Thus commanded, the mare moved forward once more, but this time
much slower. Once or twice her feet seemed to stick fast, but
Pawnee Brown did not notice this. At last she came to a dead halt
and would not go another step.</p>
<p>"The danger must be in the timber," thought the boomer. "Bonnie
Bird wouldn't balk for nothing. I'll dismount and reconnoitre."</p>
<p>Springing to the ground, he drew his pistol and moved forward
silently. Scarcely had he taken a dozen steps than he realized the
cause of his mare's unwillingness to proceed further.</p>
<p>He was in a bed of quicksand.</p>
<p>Anybody who knows what a bed of quicksand is knows how dangerous
it is&#8212;dangerous to both man and beast. Just as the scout made
his discovery he sank up to his knees in the mass.</p>
<p>"By Jove! I must get back out of this, and in double-quick
order," he muttered, and tried to turn, to find himself sinking up
to his waist.</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown was now fully alive to the grave peril of his
situation.</p>
<p>He tried by all the strength at his command to pull himself to
the firm ground from which he had started.</p>
<p>He could not budge a foot. True, he took one step, but it was
only to sink in deeper than ever.</p>
<p>Several minutes of great anxiety passed. He had sunk very nearly
up to his armpits.</p>
<p>Quarter of an hour more and he would be up to his head, and
then&#8212;&#8212;? Brave as he was, the great scout did not dare
to think further. The idea of a death in the treacherous quicksand
was truly horrible.</p>
<p>His friends would wonder what had become of him, but it was not
likely that they would ever find his body.</p>
<p>And even faithful Bonnie Bird would be dumb, so far as telling
the particulars of her master's disappearance was concerned.</p>
<p>The mare now stood upon the edge of the quicksands, fifteen feet
off, whining anxiously. She knew as well as though she had been a
human being that something was wrong.</p>
<p>Suddenly an inspiration came to Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>"How foolish! Why didn't I think of that before?" he
muttered.</p>
<p>At his belt had hung a lariat, placed there when the wagon train
started, in case any of the animals should attempt to run off in
the darkness.</p>
<p>The boomer could use a lariat as well as Clemmer or any of the
cowboys. More than once, riding at full speed upon his mare, he had
thrown the noose around any foot of a steer that was selected by
those looking on.</p>
<p>He put his hand down to his waist and felt for the lariat. It
was still there, and he brought it up and swung it over his head,
to free it from the quicksand.</p>
<p>As has been stated, the belt of timber was not far away, the
nearest tree being less than fifty feet from where he remained
stuck.</p>
<p>Preparing the lariat, he threw the noose up and away from him.
It circled through the air and fell over the nearest branch of the
tree. Hauling it taut, Pawnee Brown tested it, to make sure it
would not slip, and then began to haul himself up, as Rasco had
done at the swamp hole.</p>
<p>It was slow work, and more than once he felt that the lariat
would break, so great was the strain put upon it.</p>
<p>But it held, and a few minutes later Pawnee Brown found himself
with somewhat cut hands, safe in the branches of the tree.</p>
<p>Winding up the lariat, he descended to the ground, and made a
detour to where Bonnie Bird remained standing, and to where he had
cast his pistol.</p>
<p>The mare and weapon secured, he continued on his way, but made
certain to wander into no more quicksand spots.</p>
<p>"It was too narrow an escape for comfort," was the way in which
Pawnee Brown expressed himself, when he told the story later.</p>
<p>An hour after found him again among the boomers.</p>
<p>Mike Delaney was just coming in by the Allen trail. The Irishman
was much crestfallen over his failure to find a better trail than
that selected by the scout, and Rosy was giving it to him with a
vengeance.</p>
<p>"Th' nixt toime ye go forward it will be undher Pawnee Brown's
directions, Moike Delaney!" she cried. "It's not yerself thot is as
woise as Moses in the wilderness, moind thot!" And her clenched
fist shook vigorously to emphasize her words. After that Delaney
never strayed from the proper trail again.</p>
<p>All of the boomers but Jack Rasco were now on hand, and as hour
after hour went by and Rasco did not turn up, Pawnee Brown grew
anxious about the welfare of his right-hand man.</p>
<p>"Looking for the girl had brought him into trouble, more than
likely," he thought, as he rode away from Honnewell, taking a due
south course. "And what can have become of her?"</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown was on his way to the spot where he had left Dick.
He had decided that as soon as he had found the lad, he would
return to camp, and then the onward march of the boomers for
Oklahoma should at once be begun.</p>
<p>On through the ravine where he had met Yellow Elk he dashed,
Bonnie Bird feeling fresh after a short rest and her morning meal,
for the sun was now creeping skyward. On through the brush, and he
turned toward the open prairie.</p>
<p>"Halt! Throw up your hands!"</p>
<p>The unexpected command came from the thicket on the edge of the
prairie. On the instant the boomer wheeled about. The sight which
met his gaze caused his heart to sink within him. There, drawn up
in line, was the full troop of cavalry sent out by the government
to stop the boomers' entrance to the much-coveted territory.</p>
<p>Vorlange's spy work was responsible, and Pawnee Brown's
carefully-laid plan had fallen through.</p>

<h3>DICK'S DISAGREEABLE DISCOVERY.</h3>
<p>"Lost!"</p>
<p>Dick murmured the word over and over again, as he peered through
the brush, first in one direction and then in another.</p>
<p>"I ought to have kept track of where I was going," he went on
bitterly. "Of course, away out here one place is about as good as
another for hiding, but how am I going to find the others, or,
rather, how are they going to find me, when they come back?"</p>
<p>He pushed on for nearly a quarter of an hour; then, coming to a
flat rock, threw himself down for reflection.</p>
<p>"Just my luck!" he muttered. "I'll have to have a string tied
about my neck like a poodle dog. What a clown I was to go it blind!
But Nellie's cry for help made me forget everything else. Poor
girl! I do hope she is safe. If that redskin&#8212;gosh! what's
that?"</p>
<p>The flat rock was backed up by a number of heavy bushes. From
these bushes had come a peculiar noise, half grunt, half yawn! Dick
leaped to his feet, the bushes parted and there appeared the savage
face of Yellow Elk!</p>
<p>Dick knew the Indian by that plume of which he had heard so
much. He rightfully guessed that Yellow Elk had been taking a nap
behind the bushes. He had been shot in the thigh, and this, coupled
with the fact that he had had no sleep for two nights, had made him
very weary.</p>
<p>As the Indian chief shoved his face into view he caught sight of
Dick and uttered a slight huh! Up came the boy's weapon, but on the
instant Yellow Elk disappeared.</p>
<p>For the moment Dick was too paralyzed to move. Like a flash he
realized that Yellow Elk had the better of him, for the Indian was
behind shelter, while he stood in a clearing.</p>
<p>"White boy stand still!" came in guttural tones from the
redskin. "Don't dare move, or Indian shoot."</p>
<p>"What do you want of me?" asked Dick.</p>
<p>"White boy all alone?"</p>
<p>"What business is that of yours?"</p>
<p>At this Yellow Elk muttered a grunt. Then from out of the bushes
Dick saw thrust the shining barrel of a horse pistol.</p>
<p>"White boy throw down little shooter," commanded the redskin. By
little shooter he meant Dick's pistol.</p>
<p>There was no help for it, and the youth did as requested.</p>
<p>"White boy got udder shooter?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Now say if white boy alone. Speak if want to save life."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am alone, Yellow Elk."</p>
<p>"Ha! you know Yellow Elk?" cried the Indian in surprise.</p>
<p>"I've heard of you."</p>
<p>"What white boy do here?"</p>
<p>"I am lost."</p>
<p>"Lost. Huh!" and a look of disgust crossed the Indian chiefs
face. The idea of a human being losing his way was something he
could not understand. During his life he had covered thousands of
miles of prairie and forest lands and had never yet lost himself.
Such is the training and instinct of a true American
aboriginal.</p>
<p>While speaking Yellow Elk had leaped through the brush, and now
he came up and peered into Dick's face. Instantly his eyes filled
with anger.</p>
<p>"I know white boy; he friend to Pawnee Brown. Indian see him at
big moving."&#8212;meaning the camp of the boomers. He had not
noticed Dick in the fight at the cave.</p>
<p>"Yes, Pawnee Brown is my friend," answered Dick. "Where is he
now?" he added, to throw the Indian off the series of questions he
was propounding.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown dead!" muttered Yellow Elk simply. "White boy come
with me."</p>
<p>"With you!" ejaculated Dick, a chill creeping up to his
heart.</p>
<p>"Yes; come now. No wait, or Yellow Elk shoot!" and again the
horse pistol was raised.</p>
<p>The tone was so ugly that Dick felt it would be useless to hang
back. Yellow Elk pointed with his arm in the direction he wished
the lad to proceed, and away they went, the Indian but a pace
behind, and keeping his pistol where it would be ready for use
whenever required.</p>
<p>Dick never forgot that walk in the starlight, taken at about the
same time that Pawnee Brown was floundering in the quicksand. A
mile or more was covered, over prairies, through a wood and across
several small streams, for the fertile Indian Territory abounds in
water courses. Yellow Elk stuck to him like a shadow, and the
pistol was continually in evidence. Yellow Elk had likewise
appropriated Dick's weapon, the one cast to the ground.</p>
<p>Presently a clearing was gained where stood a cabin built of
logs. All about the place was deserted. Going up to the cabin the
Indian opened the door and lit a match.</p>
<p>"White boy go inside and we have talk," said Yellow Elk, when
there came a noise from the woods beyond. At once Yellow Elk pushed
Dick into the cabin and bolted the door from the outside.</p>
<p>"White boy keep quiet or Yellow Elk come in and kill!" he
hissed, in a low but distinct tone. "No make a sound till Indian
open door again."</p>
<p>The Indian's words were so terrifying that Dick stood still for
several minutes exactly where he had been thrust. All was pitch
dark around him. He listened, but not a sound reached his ears.</p>
<p>"Where in the world is this adventure going to end?" was the
thought which coursed through his mind.</p>
<p>He wondered what had alarmed Yellow Elk. Was it the approach of
some white friend? Fervidly he prayed it might be.</p>
<p>A low, half-suppressed cough from somewhere close at hand caught
his ear and made him start.</p>
<p>"Who is there?" he asked aloud.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick Arbuckle, is that you?" came in an eager voice.</p>
<p>"Nellie Winthrop! Is it possible? Where are you?"</p>
<p>"In the next room."</p>
<p>"Can't you come out?"</p>
<p>"No; I'm locked in."</p>
<p>"Gosh, you don't say!" Forgetting his former fear, Dick hurried
across the cabin floor to the door of the inner apartment. Feeling
around in the dark he found a hasp and staple and pulled out the
plug which fastened the barrier. In another instant boy and girl
plumped into each other's arms in the darkness. Even in that moment
of peril Dick could not resist giving Nellie a little squeeze,
which she did not resent.</p>
<p>"But how came you here?" asked the youth quickly.</p>
<p>"I was captured by a government spy, who wants to get from me
some secret of the boomers. He is a bad-looking man, and I was
awfully afraid of him."</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk brought me here. We are prisoners together. Some
noise in the woods just took Yellow Elk off."</p>
<p>"The man has been gone less than five minutes. Perhaps they are
in league with each other," suggested Nellie.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, or they may be enemies. But never mind how that
stands. We must get away, Nellie, and that before Yellow Elk comes
back."</p>
<p>"Heaven knows, I am willing!" gasped the trembling girl. "I want
no more of Yellow Elk."</p>
<p>"The window is nailed up," went on Dick, after an examination.
"And the Indian fastened that door from the outside. I wonder if I
can't get out by way of the roof?" He lit a match and gazed upward.
"There is an opening. Here goes!"</p>
<p>In another instant he was climbing up beside the fireplace, to
where a scuttle led to the sloping roof. He was soon without, and
Nellie heard him drop to the ground. Then the outer door was thrown
back.</p>
<p>"Quick! The Indian is coming back, and there is somebody with
him!" whispered Dick, and, taking hold of Nellie's hand, he led her
away as fast as possible. Their course was from the rear of the
cabin and across a broad but shallow stream.</p>
<p>"We'll go down the stream a bit before we land," said Dick, as
they were on the point of stepping out of the water. "That may
serve to throw Yellow Elk off the trail."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but do hurry!" answered the girl. "If Yellow Elk gets
hold of me again I'll die!" The fear of getting into the clutches
of the red man was so great she trembled from head to foot and
would have gone down had not Dick's strong arm supported her.</p>
<p>It was wonderful how strong the youth felt, now that he had
somebody besides himself to protect. It is said that nature fits
the back to the burden, and it must have been so in this case. For
himself, he might have feared to face Yellow Elk single-handed;
defending Nellie he would, if called upon, have faced a dozen
redskins.</p>
<p>On and on they went, as silently as possible. The trees overhung
the brook from both sides, making it pitch dark beneath.</p>
<p>A distance of fifty yards had been covered, when they heard a
loud exclamation of rage, followed by an Indian grunt.</p>
<p>"The white man and the Indian have met and both have discovered
our flight," whispered Dick. "Come, we will leave the stream and
take to yonder woods. Surely among those trees we can find some
safe hiding place."</p>
<p>They turned in toward shore. As they were about to step to dry
land Nellie's foot slipped on a round stone, making a loud splash.
At the same time the girl gave a faint cry.</p>
<p>"My ankle&#8212;it's twisted!"</p>
<p>"Quick! let me carry you!" returned Dick, and, seeing the ankle
must pain her not a little, he picked her up in his arms and dove
in among the trees.</p>
<p>They were not a moment too soon, for the ready ears of Yellow
Elk had heard the splash and the cry, and now he came bounding in
the direction, with Louis Vorlange at his heels.</p>
<hr width="30%"  size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>DICK HITS HIS MARK.</h3>
<p>"They are coming closer, Dick! What shall we do?"</p>
<p>It was Nellie Winthrop who asked the question. Boy and girl had
entered the woods a distance of fifty feet from the bank of the
brook, and both rested where several large rocks and some
overhanging bushes afforded a convenient hiding place.</p>
<p>"Keep quiet, Nellie," he said in a murmur, with his lips close
to her shell-like ears. And he gripped her arm to show her that he
would stand by her no matter what danger might befall them.</p>
<p>It would have been foolhardy to say more, for Yellow Elk and
Louis Vorlange were now within hearing distance, and the ears of
the Indian chief were more than ever on the alert. The government
spy had lighted a torch, which he swung low to the brook bank,
while Yellow Elk made an examination of the ground.</p>
<p>"Here footmarks!" grunted the redskin, a minute later, and
pointed them out. "They go this way&#8212;cannot be far off."</p>
<p>"Then after them," muttered Vorlange. "It was through your
stupidity that the girl got away. Yellow Elk, I always put you down
for being smarter than that."</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk smart enough!" growled the Indian chief.</p>
<p>"No, you're not. In some things you are like a block of wood,"
grumbled Vorlange. The escape of Nellie had put him out a good
deal.</p>
<p>The manner of the government spy provoked the Indian. To be
called a block of wood is, to the red man, a direct insult. Yellow
Elk straightened up.</p>
<p>"White man big fool!" he hissed. "Yellow Elk not make chase for
him," and he folded his arms.</p>
<p>"You won't go after the boy and the girl?" queried Vorlange.</p>
<p>"No&#8212;white man hunt for himself if he want to catch the
little woman again."</p>
<p>And having thus delivered himself, Yellow Elk sat down by the
brook and refused to budge another step.</p>
<p>The Indian's objections to continuing the search were more
numerous than appeared on the surface. The so-called insult, bad as
it was, was merely an excuse to hide other motives. Yellow Elk had
known Vorlange for years and as the spy was naturally a mean
fellow, the redskin hated him accordingly.</p>
<p>Another reason for refusing to go ahead was that Yellow Elk knew
only too well that if Dick and Nellie were again taken, Vorlange
would consider both his own captives, and Yellow Elk would be
"counted out" of the entire proceedings. He could not go to the
agency and claim any glory, for he had run away without permission,
although he had told Vorlange he was away on a special mission
connected with the soldiers.</p>
<p>And deeper than all was the thought that if he did not capture
Nellie now, he might do so later on, when he had separated from the
spy. Ever since he had first seen the beautiful girl he had been
covetous of making her his squaw. Indian fashion, he felt he could
compel Nellie to choose him, even if he had to whip her into making
the choice.</p>
<p>"You won't go on with the search?" cried Vorlange, in a
rage.</p>
<p>"No," was the short answer.</p>
<p>"I say you shall! See here, Yellow Elk, do you want to be
shot?"</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk not afraid of Vorlange&#8212;Vorlange know dat.
Yellow Elk go back to cabin to see if girl or boy leave anything
behind."</p>
<p>Then he got up, waded across the brook again and disappeared
among the trees surrounding the log cabin.</p>
<p>Louis Vorlange muttered a good many things in a very angry tone.
Then, torch in hand, he started up the brook bank to follow the
trail alone.</p>
<p>Dick and Nellie listened to the quarrel with bated breath. Both
hoped that Vorlange would follow to the cabin. When he approached
closer than ever, their hearts seemed to almost stop beating.</p>
<p>Feeling that a contest was at hand, Dick groped around in the
darkness for some weapon. No stick was at hand, but at his feet lay
a jagged stone weighing all of a pound. He took it up and held it
in readiness.</p>
<p>Closer and closer came Vorlange, turning now to the right and
now to the left, for following the trail among the rocks and brush
was no easy matter.</p>
<p>"Might as well give yourselves up!" he called out. "I am bound
to spot you sooner or later."</p>
<p>To this neither offered any reply, but Dick felt Nellie shiver.
They could now see the flare of the torch plainly, for Vorlange was
less than thirty feet away.</p>
<p>Presently the spy uttered a low cry of pleasure. He had found
several footprints, where Dick had slipped from a rock into the
dirt. Now he came straight for them, waving the torch above his
head that it might throw its light to a greater distance.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="p179" id="p179"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src=

"" /></div>
<h5>"Dick had let fly the jagged stone,
taking him directly in the forehead and keeling him over like a
tenpin"</h5>
<br />
<p>"So there you are!" The man caught sight of Nellie's dress. "I
told you I would catch you. It's not such an easy matter to get
away from Louis Vorlange. The next time I lock you
up&#8212;oh!"</p>
<p>A deep groan escaped the spy. Dick had let fly the jagged stone,
taking him directly in the forehead and keeling him over like a
tenpin. The blow left a deep cut from which the blood flowed in a
stream, and Vorlange was completely stunned.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick, have you&#8212;you&#8212;killed him?" burst from
Nellie's lips, in horror.</p>
<p>"I guess not, Nellie; he's stunned, that's all. Come, let us run
for it again&#8212;before that Indian changes his mind and comes
back."</p>
<p>"You might take his pistol," suggested the quick-witted
girl.</p>
<p>"A good idea&#8212;I will. Now let me carry you again, I see you
can hardly stand on that foot." For Nellie had limped along a dozen
steps in great pain.</p>
<p>"But I am so heavy, Dick&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Never mind, I can carry you a little distance, at least."</p>
<p>"You had better save yourself and let me go."</p>
<p>"What! Nellie, do you think me so selfish? Never! Come, and
we'll escape or die in the attempt."</p>
<p>And catching her up as before, he started off on as rapid a gait
as the weight of his fair burden would permit.</p>
<p>A distance of a hundred yards had been covered and Dick found
himself ascending a slight hill. The climb was by no means easy,
yet he kept on manfully, knowing what capture by Yellow Elk might
mean.</p>
<p>"He would tomahawk me and carry Nellie off," he thought, and it
would be hard to say which he thought the worst, the tomahawking or
the carrying off of the girl for whom he entertained such a high
regard.</p>
<p>The top of the hill reached, they saw before them a broad
stretch of open prairie, flanked to the north and the south by the
woods from which they had just emerged.</p>
<p>"I'll be thrashed if I know where we are," he said. "Have you
any idea?"</p>
<p>"No, Dick, I am completely bewildered."</p>
<p>"I wonder if it is safe to attempt to cross this prairie? It is
pretty dark, but that redskin has mighty sharp eyes."</p>
<p>"Let us go down to the edge of the woods first and rest a bit. I
am sure you are pretty well out of breath, and if I can bathe my
ankle in some cold water perhaps I'll be able to walk on it before
long."</p>
<p>"Don't try it, Nellie; I'll carry you," and again the youth
picked her up.</p>
<p>It was not long before they reached a convenient hollow, where
there was a small pool. Here Nellie made herself comfortable and
took off the shoe which hurt her so much. Bathed, the ankle which
had been twisted felt much better. It was still, however, much
swollen, and to walk far on that foot was as yet out of the
question.</p>
<p>An hour went by, a quiet hour, in which only the cries of the
night birds and the occasional hoot of an owl disturbed them. They
conversed in whispers and Dick's ears were ever on the alert, for
he felt certain that Vorlange or Yellow Elk would sooner or later
continue the search for them.</p>
<p>Nellie was very sleepy and at last her eyes closed and she
dropped into a slumber upon Dick's shoulder, forming such a pretty
picture the youth could do nothing but admire her. "I'll save
her&#8212;I must do it!" he murmured, and kissed her wavy tresses
softly.</p>
<p>It wanted still two hours to sunrise when he awakened her. She
leaped up with a start.</p>
<p>"I have been asleep! Oh, Dick, why did you let me drop off?"</p>
<p>"I knew how tired you must be after going through all you did.
But we must be on our way now, before it grows lighter. How is the
foot?"</p>
<p>"It is stiff, but much better. Which way shall we go?"</p>
<p>"Let us strike across the prairie and to the north. That is
bound to bring us into Kansas sooner or later, and once there we'll
be sure to locate the boomers without much trouble."</p>
<p>Both were hungry, but, as there was no food at hand, neither
said a word on that point. Getting a drink at a running brook close
by, they started off, Dick holding Nellie's hand, that she might
not go down on the ankle that was still weak.</p>
<p>Only a corner of the broad prairie passed, and then they turned
again into a woods. The sun was now up and it was growing
warmer.</p>
<p>"I'll shoot a few birds if I can't find anything else," said
Dick. "We can't starve, and birds broiled over a fire will make a
fair meal."</p>
<p>"But the noise?" began Nellie.</p>
<p>"I know; but, as I said, we can't starve, Nellie. We'll have to
take the risk. Here goes!"</p>
<p>Dick crept forward to where half a dozen birds sat on a nearby
bush. The birds were in a flutter over something, but Dick did not
notice this. Bringing two of the birds into range for a single
shot, he blazed away with his pistol.</p>
<p>The sharp crack of the firearm was still echoing through the
woods when there came a roar from behind the bushes the birds had
occupied. Dick had brought down his game and more, he had struck a
bear in the shoulder. In another moment the huge beast leaped into
sight, and with angry eyes and gleaming teeth bore straight for the
astonished boy.</p>
<hr width="30%"  size="6" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER
XXIII.</h2>
<h3>THE SOLDIERS AGAIN.</h3>
<p>Never was Dick Arbuckle more astonished than when the big bear
leaped out from behind the bushes and confronted himself and Nellie
Winthrop.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick! a bear!" screamed the girl, and stood still, too
paralyzed with fright to move.</p>
<p>As we know, Dick had just brought down several birds with his
pistol&#8212;indeed it was this very shot which had clipped the
bear&#8212;and now the weapon was empty and useless, having had but
one chamber loaded.</p>
<p>But as the great beast came forward, Dick knew enough not to
stand still. He retreated in double-quick order, and forced Nellie
to accompany him. Away they went through the woods with the bear in
close pursuit.</p>
<p>At the start of the chase girl and boy were at least forty feet
in advance, but despite his bulk the bear made rapid progress, and
slowly but surely began to lessen the distance between himself and
those he sought to make his victims. Looking over his shoulder,
Dick saw him lumbering along, his mouth wide open and his blood-red
tongue hanging out as though ready to lick him in.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I&#8212;can't run any more," gasped Nellie. Her heart
was beating as though ready to break. "Oh, Dick, what shall we
do?"</p>
<p>"Here is a tree with low branches&#8212;jump for that&#8212;I
will help you up!" returned the youth, and in a few seconds they
were in the tree, a scrub oak, with the big bear underneath, eying
them angrily, and speculating upon how he could bring them down
within reach of his powerful embrace and his hungry maw.</p>
<p>"He is going to climb up," came from Nellie's lips a few seconds
later. She was right. Bruin had attacked the tree trunk and now he
was coming up slowly, as though afraid of moving into some
trap.</p>
<p>Dick did not answer, for talking would have done no good. He was
re-loading the pistol with all possible speed.</p>
<p>Crack! Dick had leaned down through the branches of the oak and
taken aim at one of those bloodshot eyes. There was a howl and a
roar, and the bear fell down with a crash that shook the forest. As
to whether the bullet had found that eye or not Dick could not
tell, but certain it was that once on the ground the bear picked
himself up in short order and started to run away.</p>
<p>"You hit him!" cried Nellie. "Oh, Dick, if only he don't come
back!"</p>
<p>"He's not going away&#8212;very far," answered the boy. The shot
had encouraged him and his blood was up. A moment later Nellie was
horrified to behold him drop to the grass and make off after the
beast.</p>
<p>"That bear will kill him sure!" she ejaculated. "Oh, Dick, come
back! please do!" she screamed.</p>
<p>A shot answered her, a shot which was quickly followed by
another. A minute of painful silence; then suddenly the bear
staggered into view with Dick at his heels.</p>
<p>"I've nailed him!" shouted the boy, joyfully, and another shot
did the work. With a groan the bear keeled over, gave a jerk or
two, and died.</p>
<p>Nellie was in such a tremble she could scarcely descend from the
tree. When she did come down she found Dick hard at work cutting
out a juicy steak from the bear's flank.</p>
<p>"We'll have a breakfast fit for a king now," he said, with a
little laugh, to scatter his former nervousness. "Just wait till I
light a fire. I must gather the driest available sticks, so as to
make as little smoke as possible."</p>
<p>"Yes, we don't want our enemies to locate us," answered the
girl, and saw to it that every twig which went on the blaze which
was kindled was as dry as a bone.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour the steak had been done to a turn, and
they sat down to eat it. It was certainly a most informal meal,
without plates or platter, and only Dick's pocket knife to cut the
steak with. Yet neither had ever enjoyed a repast more. Having
finished, they procured a drink at a flowing stream behind them,
and then Dick cut off a chunk of the bear meat, wrapped it in a bit
of skin and slung it over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"We may want another meal of it before we reach civilization,"
he explained, "Nothing like preparing one's self, when we have the
chance."</p>
<p>"It's a shame to leave such a beautiful bear skin robe behind,"
answered Nellie. "But I suppose it cannot be helped. Oh, if only we
were safe once more."</p>
<p>Again they set off on their weary tramp northward, and thus
nearly two miles were covered. The sun was now coming out strongly,
and Dick saw that his fair companion was beginning to grow
tired.</p>
<p>"We will rest a little, Nellie," he said, "I think perhaps we
can afford to take it easy now."</p>
<p>"I am so fearful that Indian is following us!" answered the girl
with a shudder. "If he should find that bear, and&#8212;Oh, Dick,
look!"</p>
<p>Nellie leaped to her feet from the seat she had just taken, and
pointed behind her. Dick gave one look and his heart sank within
him. Yellow Elk was bearing down upon them as swiftly as his long
legs would permit!</p>
<p>In his hand the Indian chief carried a gun, and as Nellie arose
he caught sight of the pair and pointed the weapon at Dick's
head.</p>
<p>"White boy throw down pistol!" he called out, when within
speaking distance.</p>
<p>"Let Yellow Elk throw down his gun," answered Dick. His pistol
was up and now he shoved Nellie behind him.</p>
<p>"White boy fool&#8212;cannot shoot against Yellow Elk," growled
the redskin. He had been following their trail since sun-up and was
somewhat winded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I can shoot. Did you see that bear I brought down?"
rejoined Dick.</p>
<p>At this the Indian frowned.</p>
<p>"Bear must have been sick&#8212;white boy no bring game down
like that if well&#8212;too powerful."</p>
<p>"I brought him down and I'll bring you down if you don't stop
where you are," was the steady answer.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick, he'll shoot you," whispered Nellie. She wanted to get
before him, but he would not allow it.</p>
<p>By this time Yellow Elk had arrived to within a dozen steps of
them. Now he stopped and the frown upon his ugly countenance
deepened.</p>
<p>"Did white boy hear what Yellow Elk said?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"Does white boy want to die?"</p>
<p>"Does Yellow Elk want to die? I can shoot as straight as
you."</p>
<p>The words had scarcely left Dick's mouth than there came a clear
click.</p>
<p>The redskin had fired point-blank at the lad, but the gun had
failed to go off, the weapon being an old one the Indian had found
at the fort&#8212;a gun some soldier had discarded as useless.</p>
<p>Following the click Nellie uttered a scream. Then came a crack
as Dick fired, and Yellow Elk uttered a yell of pain, having
received a painful wound in the side.</p>
<p>With clubbed gun the Indian now rushed in and a hand-to-hand
struggle followed. Dick fought valiantly, but was no match for the
tall redskin, and a well-directed blow laid him senseless upon the
prairie grass. "You have killed him!" screamed Nellie. She was
about to kneel at Dick's side, when Yellow Elk hauled her back.</p>
<p>"White dove come with me&#8212;boy no killed&#8212;be right
by-an-by," said the redskin.</p>
<p>"I will not go with you!" she gasped. "Let me down!" for Yellow
Elk had raised her up to his broad shoulder.</p>
<p>The redskin merely smiled grimly and set off on a swift walk,
which speedily took both Nellie and himself out of sight of poor
Dick.</p>
<p>The girl's heart was almost broken by this swift turn of
affairs. She had hoped in a few more hours to be safe among her
friends, and here she was once again the captive of the Indian she
so much feared.</p>
<p>On and on kept Yellow Elk until the stream was reached upon
which was located the log cabin where Nellie had been a prisoner.
She wondered if Yellow Elk was going to take her there again, but
she asked no questions.</p>
<p>Presently the Indian chief came to a sudden halt and raised his
head as if to listen. Nellie listened, too, and at a distance heard
the tramp of several men. At once Yellow Elk darted behind a number
of bushes.</p>
<p>"White girl make noise Yellow Elk kill!" he hissed into his fair
captive's ear, and drew his hunting knife.</p>
<p>The tramp of feet came closer. A detachment of foot soldiers
were moving through the woods. Soon they came within sight of the
pair.</p>
<p>As they came closer Nellie saw they were Government troops. A
prisoner was between them&#8212;a man. It was Jack Rasco.</p>
<p>"Uncle Jack!" she moaned, when Yellow Elk clapped his hand over
her mouth and pointed the hunting knife at her throat.</p>
<p>"Hush!" he commanded, but this was unnecessary, for the
discovery and her great fear had caused Nellie to swoon. She fell
back, and for a long while she knew no more.</p>
<p>In the meantime Dick had slowly recovered consciousness. The
blow had been a fearful one, and long after he sat up he was unable
to rise to his feet, so shaky was he in the legs. Slowly the
realization of what had occurred came back to him.</p>
<p>"Gone&#8212;poor Nellie!" he gasped, and braced himself as best
he could. Gazing around he saw that neither girl nor redskin was in
sight. Without delay he started to search for Yellow Elk's
trail.</p>
<p>He was loping along over the prairies when a shout from his left
struck upon his ears. As he gazed in the direction he beheld a
number of soldiers swooping down upon him. These were the men who
had Jack Rasco a prisoner, the cavalrymen having turned the man of
the plains over to them. In a moment Dick was surrounded.</p>
<p>"Jack!" cried the youth, and rushed up to Rasco. "What does this
mean?"</p>
<p>"It means I'm a prisoner," answered Rasco, sadly. "Have you seen
anything of Nellie?"</p>
<p>In a moment Dick had told his story, to which the soldiers as
well as Rasco listened closely. At once several of the guard were
sent off to hunt up the redskin, if it were possible to do so.
Rasco wanted to go along, but his request was refused.</p>
<p>"You'll slip us if you get the chance," said the officer in
charge. "You'll go to the fort. And I fancy the boy will go, too,
since he seems to belong to the boomers."</p>
<p>And against his earnest protestations Dick was made to accompany
the soldiers, being bound hand to hand with the man of the
plains.</p>
<p>An hour later the soldiers' camp was reached, and Rasco and Dick
were placed in a temporary guard house. They had been there but a
short while when a visitor entered. It was&#8212;Louis
Vorlange!</p>
<p>"So they have you safe, I see," began Vorlange, when Rasco
sprang at him and knocked him down.</p>
<p>"Will you make my niece a prisoner," he cried, wrathfully, for
Dick had told him the story. "You dirty spy!"</p>
<p>"Hold up," gasped Vorlange, his face growing white. "Rasco,
don't be a fool. I&#8212;I&#8212;made her a prisoner because I have
orders to arrest anybody found roaming around&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I won't argy the p'int!" roared Rasco. "I know you, Vorlange,
and so does Dick here. You robbed and nearly murdered thet boy's
father!"</p>
<p>At these words Vorlange staggered back as though struck a
blow.</p>
<p>"Who says I&#8212;I did that?" he faltered.</p>
<p>"I say so."</p>
<p>"And so do I," put in Dick, boldly. "We'll have a nice story to
tell when we are brought out for examination, I'll tell you
that."</p>
<p>Vorlange breathed hard and glared from one to the other. Then of
a sudden he caught Dick by the arm and turned him to one side.</p>
<p>"Boy, beware how you cross me," he hissed into Dick's ears.
"Beware, I say! I have known your father for years, and I have the
knowledge in my possession which can send your father to the
gallows."</p>

<h3>CHASED BY CAVALRY.</h3>
<p>"Checkmated! By Jove, but this is too bad."</p>
<p>Such were the words which issued from Pawnee Brown's lip as he
swung around and saw the cavalrymen sitting on their horses at
attention.</p>
<p>His disappointment was keen. In speaking of it afterwards he
said:</p>
<p>"I never felt so bad in my life. I had promised to take the
boomers through and I felt that I had disappointed nearly four
thousand people who were looking to me with utmost confidence."</p>
<p>But disappointment was not the worst of it. Hardly had the
command to halt been issued than the captain of the troops advanced
toward the scout.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" he ejaculated, in surprise, and a smile of
satisfaction crossed his face. "This is a great pleasure."</p>
<p>"Is it?" answered the great scout, coldly.</p>
<p>"It is indeed. Do you intend to throw up your hands?"</p>
<p>For the scout's hands had not yet been lifted skyward.</p>
<p>"This looks as if you meant to arrest me, captain."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I? You are at the head of the Kansas boomers, are
you not?"</p>
<p>"I have that honor, yes."</p>
<p>"It's a question to me if it is an honor. You are transgressing
the laws of the United States when you try to get into Oklahoma for
homestead purposes."</p>
<p>"Say rather that we transgress the laws of the cattle kings,
captain. Under the U. S. Homestead Law we have a perfect right to
this land, if we can get in and stake our claims, and you know
it."</p>
<p>"I know nothing of the sort. This talk about the cattle kings is
all nonsense!" roared the cavalry officer. He knew Pawnee Brown was
more than half right, but felt he must obey the orders he had
received from his superiors. "I'll have to take you to the
fort."</p>
<p>"All right, take me&#8212;if you can, captain," came the quick
answer. "Don't you dare fire on me, for you know I am a crack shot
and I promise I'll fire on you in return and lay you low!"</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the boomer wheeled about and sent Bonnie Bird off
like a shot along the trail he had come.</p>
<p>The movement was so quick that for the moment the cavalry
officer was paralyzed and knew not what to do. He raised his long
pistol, but Pawnee Brown's stern threat rang in his ears and he
hesitated about using the weapon, having no desire to be laid
low.</p>
<p>"After him, men!" he roared, upon recovering his wits. "We must
capture him!"</p>
<p>"Shall we fire, cap'n?" came from several, and a number of
shining pistol barrels were leveled toward the great scout.</p>
<p>"N&#8212;no, capture him alive," came the hesitating reply; and
away went the calvary men at a breakneck speed in pursuit.</p>
<p>Looking back over his shoulder, Pawnee saw them coming. To
lessen the chances of being shot, he bent low over his faithful
mare's neck.</p>
<p>"On, Bonnie, on!" he cried softly, and the beautiful animal
seemed to understand that it was a race for life and death.</p>
<p>"Crack!" It was the report of a pistol close at hand. Looking
among the trees, Pawnee Brown saw an arm wearing the colors of a
cavalryman disappearing among the foliage of a nearby tree. He
aimed his own weapon and pulled the trigger. A yell of pain
followed.</p>
<p>The marksman had been Tucker, the fellow hired to take the great
scout's life. Tucker had been on picket duty for the cavalry troop,
but had failed to note Pawnee Brown's first movement in that
direction. Seeing the scout coming, he had instantly thought of the
promised reward and taken aim. The bullet had struck Pawnee Brown's
shoulder, merely, however, scraping the skin. On the return fire
Tucker was hit in the side and nearly broke his neck in a tumble
backward into a hole behind him.</p>
<p>The chase was not of long duration. Although they had good
steeds, not one of the cavalryman's horses could gain upon the
scout's sturdy racing mare, and soon they dropped further and
further behind. Seeing this, Pawnee Brown turned to the eastward,
out of the ravine, and in three minutes had his pursuers entirely
off the trail.</p>
<p>His face grew thoughtful as he allowed Bonnie Bird to drop into
a walk. The cavalry had followed the wagon train
westward&#8212;they were bound to keep the boomers in sight. What
was to be done? Should he advise another movement during the night
to come and then a forward dash?</p>
<p>"We might make it," he mused. "But if we did not there would be
a fearful fight and possibly slaughter. I wish I knew just how
matters were going at Washington."</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown had friends at the Capital, men who were doing
their best to defeat the cattle kings by having a bill passed in
Congress opening Oklahoma to settlement&#8212;a bill that would
smooth the present difficulty for all concerned. He felt that the
bill was not needed, yet it would be better to have such a law than
to have some of the boomers killed before their rights could be
established.</p>
<p>"I'll send a messenger off to the nearest telegraph station and
telegraph for the news," he went on. "A day's delay may mean many
lives saved. It shall never be said that Pawnee Brown rushed in,
heedless of the danger to those who trusted in him."</p>
<p>It was not long before the scout reached the boomers' camp. Here
he found several waiting for him.</p>
<p>"I want to see Pawnee Brown." It was Dan Gilbert, who was making
his way through the crowd to the great scout's side. Gilbert held a
message from Arkansas City. It was to the effect that Pawnee Brown
should telegraph to Washington at once and wait until noon at
Arkansas City for a reply.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Pawnee Brown was on the trail over which the
wagon train had journeyed the night before. He had told Gilbert,
Clemmer and the others of the nearness of the Government cavalrymen
and had advised a halt until further orders from himself. Clemmer
had promised to wait, although ready "ter swoop down on 'em, b'
gosh, an' take wot belongs ter us," as he expressed himself.</p>
<p>The ride back to Arkansas City was an uneventful one, and
arriving there, Pawnee Brown lost no time in visiting the telegraph
office.</p>
<p>"A message for you," said the operator, and handed it over.</p>
<p>It was from Washington and stated: "The Oklahoma bill is now
before the Lower House; wait for more news."</p>
<p>"I'm glad we've woke up those politicians at Washington,"
murmured the scout, and then wrote out a telegram in reply.</p>
<p>There was now nothing to do but to wait, and impatient as he was
to rejoin the boomers, Pawnee Brown had to content himself until
another message should reach him. To make the time pass more
quickly the great scout went around to a number of places buying
supplies that were much needed.</p>
<p>An hour later he found himself on the outskirts of the city,
whence he had come to look up several wagons, to replace some that
had broken down. He was galloping along on horseback when the sight
of two men quarreling near the open doorway of a deserted barn
caught his eye, and impelled by something which was more than
curiosity, he turned in from the road to see how the quarrel might
end. As he came closer he saw that one of the men was Mortimer
Arbuckle!</p>
<p>"Hullo, what can this mean?" he cried, softly. "I thought Dick's
father was still in bed from the effects of that dastardly night's
work. Who can that stranger be?"</p>
<p>Dismounting, he tied Bonnie Bird to a tree and came forward, but
in line with the barn, that he might not be seen. Soon he was
within easy hearing distance of all that was being said.</p>
<p>"I want to know what brought you out here, Dike Powell?" he
heard Mr. Arbuckle say in excited tones. "Did you follow me?"</p>
<p>"No, I did not, Arbuckle," came in reply. "What makes you think
I did?"</p>
<p>"I was knocked down and robbed but a few nights ago, and my most
valuable papers, as well as my money, were taken from me."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to insinuate that I am a thief?" cried Dike
Powell.</p>
<p>"You are none too good for it. I have not forgotten how you used
to sneak around my office in New York after information concerning
my Western mining claims."</p>
<p>"You're getting mighty sharp, Arbuckle."</p>
<p>"I hope I am. I used to feel queer in my head at times,
but&#8212;but&#8212;I think I am growing better of that."</p>
<p>As he spoke Mortimer Arbuckle drew his white hand across his
forehead.</p>
<p>The attack and the adventure on the river had been fearful, but
it really looked as if they were going to prove of benefit to him.
His eyes were brighter than they had been for many a day. Pawnee
Brown noticed, too, that his manner of talking was more direct than
he usually employed.</p>
<p>"I hope for the boy's sake his mind is clearing," he
thought.</p>
<p>"I think you are growing more queer&#8212;to accuse me," said
Dike Powell. "I never harmed you."</p>
<p>"I know better. While I was on my back I thought it all over.
Dike Powell, you are a villain, and if ever I get the chance I'll
turn you over to the police. You have followed me to the West, and
for no good purpose. I will unmask you."</p>
<p>"Will you? Not much!"</p>
<p>Thus speaking, Dike Powell leaped forward. He was a powerful
man, and catching Mortimer Arbuckle by the throat, he would have
borne the semi-invalid to the floor had not Pawnee Brown
interfered.</p>
<p>There was a rush and a crack, as the scout's fist met Dike
Powell's ear, and over the man rolled, to bring up against the side
of the barn with a crash.</p>
<p>"Who&#8212;who hit me?" spluttered the rascal, as, half dazed,
he staggered to his feet. "If I&#8212;Pawnee Brown!"</p>
<p>"Dike Powell!" ejaculated the scout, as he saw the fellow full
in the face for the first time. "Where have you been these long
years?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Pawnee, how glad I am that you came in," panted Mortimer
Arbuckle, sinking down upon an old feed box. "The villain
was&#8212;was&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I saw it all, Arbuckle; rest yourself. I will take care of this
forger."</p>
<p>"Forger!" came simultaneously from Mortimer Arbuckle and from
his assailant, but in different tones of voice. "Do you then know
Dike Powell?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know him as Powell Dike, a forger, who fled from Peoria
a dozen years ago. And what do you know of him?"</p>
<p>"I know him as a Wall street sneak&#8212;a man who was forever
hanging around, trying to get information out of which he might
make a few dollars. I have accused him of following me to the West.
I am inclined to think he robbed me&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I did not," ejaculated Powell Dike, for such really was his
name.</p>
<p>"I believe you," replied Pawnee Brown. He had spoken to Dick and
Rasco of this man. "But you know who did rob Mortimer Arbuckle," he
went on, significantly.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I&#8212;do not," answered Powell Dike, but his lips
trembled.</p>
<p>"You lie, Dike. Now tell the truth."</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown saw the manner of man he had to deal with and
tapped his pistol. Instantly Powell Dike fell upon his knees.</p>
<p>"Don't&#8212;don't shoot me!" he whined. "I'll tell
all&#8212;everything. I am not dead positive, but&#8212;but I guess
Louis Vorlange robbed Arbuckle."</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown looked at Mortimer Arbuckle to see what effect this
declaration might have upon Dick's father. He saw the ex-stock
broker start forward in amazement. Then he faltered, threw up his
hands, and fell forward in a dead faint!</p>

<h3>GOOD NEWS FROM WASHINGTON.</h3>
<p>"Fainted, by Jove!"</p>
<p>So spoke Pawnee Brown as he sprang forward to Mortimer
Arbuckle's aid.</p>
<p>The man was as pale as the driven snow, and for the instant the
great scout thought his very heart had stopped beating.</p>
<p>He raised Mortimer Arbuckle up and opened his collar and took
off his tie, that he might get some air.</p>
<p>"Wot's the row here?"</p>
<p>It was the voice of Peter Day, the backwoodsman who had agreed
to take care of Arbuckle during his illness. He had followed the
man out of the house to see that no harm might befall him.</p>
<p>"He has fainted," answered Pawnee Brown. "Fetch some water, and
hold that&#8212;hang it, he's gone!"</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown rushed to the barn door. Far away he saw Powell
Dike running as though the old Nick was after him. A second later
the rascal disappeared from view. The boomer never saw or heard of
him again.</p>
<p>Between the great scout and Pawnee Brown, Mortimer Arbuckle was
once again taken to Day's home and made comfortable.</p>
<p>"He insisted on taking a walk to-day," explained the
backwoodsman. "I told him he couldn't stand it. I reckon he's as
bad now as he ever was."</p>
<p>"Take good care of him, Day, and beware of any men who may be
prowling about," answered Pawnee Brown. "There is something wrong
in the air, but I'm satisfied that if we help this poor fellow
we'll be on the right side of the brush."</p>
<p>Mortimer Arbuckle was now coming around, but when he spoke he
was quite out of his mind. The doctor was hastily sent for, and he
administered a potion which speedily put the sufferer to sleep.</p>
<p>"It's an odd case," said the medical man. "The fellow is
suffering more mentally than physically. He must have something
awful on his mind."</p>
<p>"He is the victim of some plot&#8212;I am certain of it," was
the scout's firm answer.</p>
<p>Not long after this, Pawnee Brown was returning to Arkansas
City, certain that Mortimer Arbuckle would now be well cared for
and closely watched until he and Dick could return to the
sufferer.</p>
<p>"As soon as this booming business is over I must try to clear
things for that old gent," murmured the boomer to himself as he
rode up to the telegraph office. "I'd do a good deal for him and
that noble son of his."</p>
<p>Another telegram had just come in, by way of Wichita, which ran
as follows:</p>
<p>"The Lower House of Congress has passed the Oklahoma bill.
Pawnee Brown has woke the politicians up at last. Stand ready to
enter Oklahoma if an attempt is made to throw the bill aside in the
Senate, but don't be rash, as it may not be long before everything
comes our way&#8212;in fact, it looks as if everything would come
very soon."</p>
<p>At this telegram the great scout was inclined to throw up his
hat and give a cheer. His work in Kansas was having an effect. No
longer could the cattle kings stand up against the rights of the
people. He handed the message to a number of his friends standing
near.</p>
<p>"Hurrah fer Pawnee Brown!" shouted one man, and standing on a
soap box read the telegram aloud.</p>
<p>"Score one fer the boomers!"</p>
<p>"An' a big one fer Pawnee."</p>
<p>"Don't hurry now, Pawnee, you've got 'em whar the hair ez good
an' long!"</p>
<p>"It would seem so, men," answered the great scout. "No, I'll be
careful now&#8212;since the tide has turned. In less than sixty
days I'll wager all I am worth we'll march into Oklahoma without
the first sign of trouble."</p>
<p>It did not take the news long to travel to the boomers' camp,
and great was the rejoicing upon every side.</p>
<p>"Dot's der pest ding I vos hear for a month," said Humpendinck.
"Pawnee ought to haf a medal alreatty."</p>
<p>"It's a stattoo we will put up fer him in Oklahomy," said
Delaney. "A stattoo wid Pawnee a-ridin' loike mad to the new lands,
wid the Homestead act in wan hand an' a bundle o' sthakes in th'
other, an' under the stattoo we'll put the wurruds, 'Pawnee Brown,
the St. Patrick av Oklahomy!'"</p>
<p>"Ach! go on mit yer St. Patrick!" howled Humpendinck. "He vos
noddings but a snake killer."</p>
<p>"Oh, mon!" burst in Rosy Delaney. "A snake killer, Moike, do ye
moind thot? Swat the Dootchman wan, quick!"</p>
<p>And Mike "swatted" with an end of a fence rail he was chopping
up for firewood. But Humpendinck dodged, and Rosy caught the blow,
and there followed a lively row between her and Mike, in the midst
of which the German boomer sneaked away.</p>
<p>"Dot Irishmans vos so fiery as der hair mit his head," he
muttered to himself. "I dink I vos keep out of sight bis he vos
cool off, and den&#8212;Mine gracious, Bumpkin, var did you come
from? I dinks you vos left behind py Arkansas City."</p>
<p>For there had suddenly appeared before Humpendinck the form of
the dunce, hatless and with his black hair tumbled over his face in
all directions.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! where have I been?" cried Pumpkin. "Where haven't I
been you had better ask. I've been everywhere&#8212;among the
soldiers and the boomers and the Indians." He stopped short. "Where
is Pawnee Brown?"</p>
<p>"Ofer py Clemmer's vagon. But he ton't vont ter pother mit you
now."</p>
<p>"He will bother with me," and so speaking Pumpkin ran off, to
reach the great scout's side and pluck him by the coat sleeve.</p>
<p>"At your service, sir," he said, bowing low, for with all of his
peculiarities Pumpkin had a great respect for Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>"What is it, lad?"</p>
<p>"I have to report, sir, that your pard is captured&#8212;Jack
Rasco; he had a fearful fight and the soldiers have him. Ha! ha!
they will shoot Jack&#8212;if you let 'em, but I know you
won't&#8212;will you now?"</p>
<p>"You are certain Jack is captured?"</p>
<p>"Dead sure&#8212;saw him with my own eyes. Ha! ha! they tried to
catch Pumpkin, but they might as well try to catch a ghost. Ha! ha!
but I give 'em a fine run."</p>
<p>It took a good deal of talking to get a straight story from the
half-witted youth, but at last Pawnee Brown was in full possession
of the facts. Pumpkin had seen Rasco on the march just before Dick
was taken.</p>
<p>Immediately after this the boomer held a short consultation with
Clemmer.</p>
<p>"I feel it my duty to help Rasco to escape, if it can be done,"
he said. "Besides, it is high time for me to return to Dick
Arbuckle and to find out, if possible, what has become of Jack's
niece."</p>
<p>"Shall I go along?" questioned Clemmer, "I wouldn't like
anything better."</p>
<p>"All right, come on," answered the great scout.</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when a loud cry rang out, coming from the
lower end of the camp.</p>
<p>"Buckley's bull has broken loose! Look out for yourself, the
beast has gone mad!"</p>
<p>"Buckley's bull!" muttered Pawnee Brown. "I ordered him to
slaughter that vicious beast. Why, he's as fierce as those the
Mexicans use in their bull fights!"</p>
<p>"He's a terror," answered Clemmer. "If he&#8212;By gum, here he
comes, Pawnee!"</p>
<p>As he spoke Clemmer turned to one side and started to run.
Looking forward the great scout saw the bull bearing down upon him.
The eyes of the creature were bloodshot and the foam was dripping
from the corners of his mouth, showing that he was clearly beyond
control.</p>
<p>The bull, which was of extra large size, had Clemmer in view,
and made after the cowboy, who happened to be unarmed. Away went
man and beast in something of a circle, to fetch up near Pawnee
Brown less than a minute later. As they came close, Clemmer fell
and went sprawling almost at the scout's feet.</p>
<p>"Save me!" he panted. "Save me, Pawnee!"</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown did not answer. Leaping over the cowboy's prostrate
form, he pulled out his pistol and his hunting knife and stood
ready to receive the bull, who came tearing along, with lowered
horns, ready to charge the scout to the death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>THE BOOMER AND THE BULL.</h3>
<p>For the moment it looked as if Pawnee Brown meant to let the mad
bull gore him to pieces.</p>
<p>On and on came the beast until less than two yards separated him
and the great scout.</p>
<p>Crack! came the report of the boomer's pistol, and the bull fell
back a pace, clipped between the horns. A lucky swerve downward had
saved him from a bullet wound through the eye.</p>
<p>There was no time for another shot. With a bellow the bull
leaped the intervening space and landed almost on top of Pawnee
Brown!</p>
<p>A yell went up from those who saw the movement.</p>
<p>"Pawnee is done fur. The bull will rip him inside out."</p>
<p>"Buckley ought to have killed that bull long ago&#8212;that's
the second time he's gone on a rampage."</p>
<p>"Somebody shoot him and save Pawnee!"</p>
<p>The last was a well meant cry, but a shot could not be thought
of, for man and beast were too close together.</p>
<p>But Pawnee Brown was not yet defeated. He still held his trusty
hunting knife, and he was not terrorized as some of the onlookers
imagined.</p>
<p>A few words will explain the cause. In his day the scout had
visited Mexico more than once, and while there had participated in
more than one bull fight, on one occasion defeating a celebrated
Mexican fighter and gaining a handsome prize.</p>
<p>As the mad bull charged, the scout leaped like lightning to one
side, and drove the hunting knife up to the hilt into the beast's
throat.</p>
<p>There was a spurt of blood, a bellow of pain, and the bull
staggered back several steps.</p>
<p>He was badly wounded, but by no means out of the fight, as his
glaring eyes still showed. He shook his head vigorously, then
charged again.</p>
<p>Once more the knife went up and came down, this time just below
the beast's ear. A fearful bellow came after the stroke. Before the
bull could retire, the knife was withdrawn and plunged in a third
and last time. This third stroke wound up the encounter, for
limping to one side the bull fell forward upon his knees, gave a
kick or two with his hind legs, and rolled over on the prairie
grass, dead.</p>
<p>"Hurrah! Pawnee has killed him."</p>
<p>"Talk about yer bull fighters! They ain't in it with
Pawnee!"</p>
<p>"Yer saved my life," exclaimed Clemmer, who had risen. "I shan't
forget yer, Pawnee," and he held out his broad hand for a
shake.</p>
<p>The bull dead, Pawnee Brown called Buckley up and gave him a
lecture for not having killed the vicious beast long ago.</p>
<p>"You have no business to bring such a bull into camp in the
first place, Buckley," he said. "Be more careful in the future, or
you'll have to get out, bag and baggage. That bull might have
killed half a dozen people had he charged the crowd."</p>
<p>A short while after this the great scout and Clemmer set off
from Honnewell along the ravine in search of Dick, Rasco and Nellie
Winthrop. The cheering news from Washington had set Pawnee Brown at
rest so far as his duty to the boomers was concerned, and he felt
quite free to pursue his own affairs and those of his immediate
friends.</p>
<p>"If possible I would like to meet Louis Vorlange and have a talk
with him," he said to Clemmer, after having related what had
occurred near Peter Day's home. "I think that spy can clear up much
of this mystery concerning Mortimer Arbuckle, if he will."</p>
<p>"It ain't likely he'll open his trap," answered Clemmer. "By
doin' thet he'd only be gettin' himself in hot water."</p>
<p>"We'll make him speak," was Pawnee Brown's grim response.</p>
<p>An hour of hard riding brought them to the spot where Dick had
been left. Not a single trace of the lad could be found. Both men
looked blank.</p>
<p>"Bet he's wandered off and got lost," said Clemmer, and Pawnee
Brown nodded.</p>
<p>"We'll strike off eastward, Cal, and see if we can't find some
trace of him. It is no use of going westward. If he had gone that
way, he would have reached the ravine and come up into Kansas."</p>
<p>Once again they set off. An hour was spent here and there, when
suddenly Clemmer uttered a cry.</p>
<p>"Been a struggle hyer, Pawnee. See them footprints?"</p>
<p>"Three people," answered the scout, making an inspection. "A
boy, a girl or a woman, and an Indian. Can they have been Dick,
Nellie Winthrop and Yellow Elk? Hang me if it doesn't look like
it."</p>
<p>"Hyer's where the trail leads off," said Clemmer. "And that's
the boy's. Can't see nuthin' o' the gal's."</p>
<p>"That means the Indian carried her off," ejaculated Pawnee
Brown. "Let us follow his trail without delay."</p>
<p>"But the boy's?"</p>
<p>"You follow that, and I'll follow the redskin. If he had the
girl I want to know it."</p>
<p>A few words more and they separated. Pawnee Brown was on his
mettle and followed Yellow Elk's trail with all the keenness of an
Indian himself. In half an hour he had reached the brook. Here he
came to a series of rocks and was forced to come to a halt.</p>
<p>But not for long. Fording the water-course, he began a search
which speedily revealed the trail again, leading to a small river a
quarter of a mile further on.</p>
<p>He followed the river for less than fifty feet, when a number of
voices broke upon his ears.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I saw the redskin on the river, and he had a girl with
him, Ross."</p>
<p>"You must have been dreaming, Tucker. No redskins up here."</p>
<p>"All right, I know what I am talking about."</p>
<p>"I think I saw something, too," said a third voice, that of
Skimmy, the calvary man.</p>
<p>The three calvary men were out on a scouting expedition, to
learn if the boomers were in the vicinity of the river.</p>
<p>Tucker especially was on the lookout for Pawnee Brown,
determined to bring the great scout down and thus win the reward
Louis Vorlange had promised.</p>
<p>The scout listened to the talk of the cavalrymen for fully ten
minutes with great interest.</p>
<p>He had just started to move on, satisfied that it would be of no
benefit to remain longer, when Tucker turned and walked his horse
directly toward the spot where he was concealed.</p>
<p>"A boomer behind the brush!" shouted the cavalryman. "Come,
boys, and take him!"</p>
<p>Immediately there was a rush, and Pawnee Brown was surrounded.
He had his pistol out and in return came the weapons of the
trio.</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen, you seem to want to make me your prisoner,"
said the scout, coolly.</p>
<p>"Thet's wot," cried Ross. "Eh, Tucker?"</p>
<p>To make Pawnee Brown a prisoner would be of no personal benefit
to him.</p>
<p>"You seem to bear me a grudge," said the boomer, eying him
sharply.</p>
<p>Tucker could not stand that gaze and his eyes dropped.</p>
<p>"Yes, you're a prisoner," said Ross. "Let's bind him up,
Skimmy."</p>
<p>"Take that!"</p>
<p>Pawnee Brown leaped forward and hurled both Ross and Skimmy to
the ground. Ere they could rise he had turned upon Tucker. The tall
calvary man had his pistol cocked, and now he blazed away almost in
Pawnee Brown's face, and then both went down, with the scout on
top.</p>
<p>The flash of the pistol had scorched the boomer's skin, but the
bullet sung over his head, missing him by less than an inch. As he
came down upon Tucker he hit the cavalryman a terrific blow in the
jaw, breaking that member and knocking out several teeth.</p>
<p>"On him!" yelled Skimmy, and tried to rise. But now Pawnee Brown
was again up, and flung Skimmy on top of Ross. In a moment more he
was running along the river bank.</p>
<p>He was almost out of sight, when there came two shots, from Ross
and Skimmy. Neither hit him, however, and he continued on his way,
while the two cavalrymen turned back to pick up Tucker, who lay in
a heap, groaning and twisting from intense pain. The tall
cavalryman could not, of course, talk, and his wound was so serious
that there was nothing to do but to carry him to his horse, support
him in the saddle and ride back to the fort for medical assistance.
It was a clean knock-out, and one that Tucker had good cause to
remember to the day of his death.</p>
<p>It was some time ere Pawnee Brown struck the trail of Yellow Elk
again, but having once spotted it he pursued his course with
increased vigor. The trail led along the river to where there was
almost a lake. This had just been reached, when he heard a scream.
Instantly he recognized Nellie Winthrop's voice.</p>
<p>"Thank heaven I came as soon as I did," he murmured, and dashed
forward to the spot from whence the sound had proceeded.</p>

XXVII.</h2>
<h3>THE LAST OF YELLOW ELK.</h3>
<p>When Nellie Winthrop recovered sufficiently to realize what was
going on around her, she found herself upon Yellow Elk's back, with
her hands tied together at the wrists behind her.</p>
<p>Away went the redskin until the vicinity where the encounter
with Dick had occurred was left far behind.</p>
<p>The brook crossed, the Indian chief set off for the river. Not
once did he stop or speak until a pond was gained.</p>
<p>Beyond the pond was a shelter of trees, growing in a circle
which was about fifteen feet in diameter. Against the trees the
brush had been piled, forming a rude hut.</p>
<p>Taking Nellie inside of this shelter, Yellow Elk deposited her
on the ground. Of the cord which bound her hands there were several
feet left, and this end he wound around a tree and tied fast.</p>
<p>"Now white girl no run away," he grinned. "Stay here now until
Yellow Elk ready to let her go."</p>
<p>To this she made no answer, for what would be the use of talking
to such a fierce creature? She looked at his hideously painted face
and shivered.</p>
<p>Yellow Elk now went off, to be gone a long while. When he came
back he found her so tired she could scarcely stand beside the
tree. She had tried to free herself from her bonds but failed, and
a tiny stream of blood was running from one of her tender
wrists.</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk got horse now," said the redskin. "We ride
now&#8212;go many miles."</p>
<p>"Where to?" she faltered.</p>
<p>"Never mind where&#8212;white girl come on."</p>
<p>Yellow Elk's manner was so fierce she was frightened more than
ever. The Indian had stolen a horse and he had also stolen a lot of
"fire-water," and this drink was beginning to make him ugly. He
drew out his hunting knife.</p>
<p>"White girl got to become Yellow Elk's squaw!" he cried,
brandishing the knife before her face. "No marry Yellow Elk me cut
out her heart wid dis!"</p>
<p>At this Nellie gave a shriek and it was this which was borne to
the ears of Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>"Crying do white girl no good," growled the redskin. "Come with
me."</p>
<p>"I will not go another foot," and Nellie began to struggle. The
Indian chief upbraided her roundly in his own language and ended by
raising his knife over her once more.</p>
<p>"Help!" cried Nellie, and a moment later Pawnee Brown burst into
view. A glance showed him the true situation, and without
hesitation he fired at Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>His bullet clipped across the redskin's chest. By this time
Yellow Elk had his own pistol out, and standing erect he aimed
straight for the boomer's heart.</p>
<p>Nellie screamed, and knowing nothing else to do, gave the Indian
a vigorous shove in the side, which destroyed the aim and made the
bullet fly wide of the mark.</p>
<p>In a second more the two men were at it in a hand-to-hand
encounter each trying his best to get at the other with his hunting
knife, being too close together to use a pistol. As Pawnee Brown
afterward said:</p>
<p>"It was Yellow Elk's life or mine, and I made up my mind that it
should not be mine&#8212;I considered myself worth a good deal more
than that worthless redskin."</p>
<p>A cut and a slash upon each side, and the two broke. Yellow Elk
had had enough of the fight, and now ran for it in sudden fear. He
did not take to the river shore, but skirted the pond and began to
ascend a slight hill, beyond which was another fork of the ravine
which has figured so largely in our story.</p>
<p>"Let him go! he may kill you!" called out Nellie, when she saw
Pawnee Brown start in pursuit. But the scout paid no attention to
her. His blood was up and he was determined to either exterminate
Yellow Elk or bring him to terms.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="p220" id="p220"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src=
"images/img224.jpg" alt="In a second more the two men were
in a hand-to-hand encounter" title=
"" /></div>
<h5>"In a second more the two men were
in a hand-to-hand encounter"</h5>
<br />
<p>The top of the hill was reached. Yellow Elk paused, not knowing
exactly how to proceed. Looking back, he saw Pawnee Brown preparing
to fire upon him. A pause, and he attempted to leap down to a ledge
below him. His foot caught in the roots of a bush and over he went
into a deep hollow headlong. There was a sickening thud, a grunt,
and all became quiet.</p>
<p>Yellow Elk had paid the death penalty at last.</p>
<p>When Pawnee Brown managed to climb down to the Indian's side, to
make certain the wily redskin was not shamming, he found Yellow Elk
stone dead, his neck having been completely broken by his fall. He
lay on his back, his right hand still clutching his bloody hunting
knife.</p>
<p>"Gone now," murmured the great scout. His face softened for an
instant. "Hang it all, why must even a redskin be so all-fired bad?
If he had wanted to, Yellow Elk might have made a man of himself. I
can't stop to bury him, and yet&#8212;&#8212;Hullo, what are those
papers sticking out of his pocket?"</p>
<p>The boomer had caught sight of a large packet which had been
concealed in Yellow Elk's bosom. He took up the packet and looked
it over. It consisted of half a dozen legal-looking documents and
twice that number of letters, some addressed to Mortimer Arbuckle
and some addressed to Louis Vorlange.</p>
<p>He read over the letters and documents with interest. Those of
Dick's father related to the mine in Colorado and were evidently
those stolen by Louis Vorlange upon the night of the opening of
this tale. The letters belonging to the government spy were
epistles addressed to Vorlange from a former friend and partner in
various shady transactions. Of these we will hear more later.</p>
<p>"Yellow Elk must have robbed Vorlange of these," mused the great
scout, as he rammed the packet in his pocket. In this he was right.
Vorlange had dropped the packet by accident and the Indian had
failed to restore it, there having been, as the reader knows, no
love lost between the two rascals.</p>
<p>Having placed the dead body among the bushes in a little hollow,
Pawnee Brown climbed out of the ravine again and rejoined Nellie,
who was growing impatient regarding his welfare. The story of what
had happened to Yellow Elk was soon told, the scout softening out
the ghastly details. Then, to change the subject, he asked her if
she knew her uncle was a prisoner of the soldiers.</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied. "Oh, sir, what will they do with him?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe they can do much, Nellie," he answered.
"According to the news from Washington, everything is to be
smoothed out, and of course the government will have no case
against any of us."</p>
<p>"Can I get to my uncle from here? Where is he?"</p>
<p>"About five miles from here. Yes, we can get to him if we want
to." Pawnee Brown mused for a moment. "I'll risk it," he said, half
aloud. "They can't arrest me for coming to expose a criminal, and I
have the facts right here in my pocket."</p>
<p>A moment later he was riding the horse Yellow Elk had stolen,
while Nellie was seated upon Bonnie Bird. In this manner they
struck out for the agency, called by the soldiers a fort.</p>
<p>About three miles had been covered, when suddenly there came a
shout from a thicket to one side of them.</p>
<p>"The cavalry!" gasped Nellie. "What shall we do?"</p>
<p>"Take it coolly, Nellie. I have a winning card this trip,"
smiled the great scout.</p>
<p>A few seconds later half a dozen fine looking men rode forward,
a well-known official of the Indian Territory at their head.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" ejaculated the official, on recognizing the
scout. "It would seem we had made quite a capture. What are you
doing with Sergeant Morris' horse?"</p>
<p>"Is this the animal?"</p>
<p>"It is.</p>
<p>"I found him in the possession of a runaway Indian, Yellow Elk.
If he is your property you are welcome to him," and Pawnee Brown
leaped to the ground.</p>
<p>"Humph! That is all right, but what are you doing here? Don't
you know you are on forbidden ground?"</p>
<p>The scout's coolness was a great surprise to the official.</p>
<p>"I would be&#8212;under ordinary circumstances, sir. But just
now I am on a mission to the agency: a mission I am convinced you
will not attempt to hinder."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I wish to expose a great criminal, a man who is now in the
active service of the United States, although he ought to be in
prison or on the gallows."</p>
<p>The official was much surprised.</p>
<p>"I would like to know some of the particulars, Pawnee."</p>
<p>"Are you bound for the agency?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then we will go together, and you can see what takes place. It
will probably be well worth your while."</p>
<p>"This is no trick&#8212;I know you are itching to get into
Oklahoma."</p>
<p>"I will give you my word of honor, sir. I have received word
from Washington, and I feel certain that ere long this whole matter
will be settled to our mutual satisfaction. In the meantime,
booming can wait," and Pawnee Brown smiled in a quiet way.</p>
<p>A few words more followed, and Nellie was introduced. Then the
whole party set off on a gallop for the agency, where was to be
enacted the last scene in this little drama of the southwest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER
XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>CLEARING UP A MYSTERY&#8212;CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p>As Vorlange uttered his dire threat into Dick's ear, the boy
turned pale and staggered against the wall of his prison.</p>
<p>"Wot's that yer sayin'?" demanded Jack Rasco, who plainly saw
the changed look upon his companion's features.</p>
<p>"It is none of your business, Rasco," muttered the spy. "I told
the boy; that's enough."</p>
<p>Dick breathed hard. Part of that mystery of the past was out at
last. His father was accused of murder&#8212;Vorlange held the
evidence against him. Like a flash came back to him several things
he had almost forgotten. He remembered how on more than one
occasion his father had sent money to the West after a letter had
come which had upset him greatly. That must have been hush money,
to keep this rascal quiet.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I&#8212;do not believe you!" he cried in a faint tone.
"My father is as upright as any gentleman in the land."</p>
<p>"Is he?" sneered Vorlange. "All right, if you think so, just
drive me to the wall and see."</p>
<p>"Where was this crime committed?"</p>
<p>"In Creede, Colorado&#8212;at the time the camp was
started."</p>
<p>"Who was killed?"</p>
<p>"A miner named Rickwell. He was once a partner of a man named
Burch, of whom you have no doubt heard ere this."</p>
<p>"Yes, Burch left us the property you know all about, since you
stole the deeds to it. Louis Vorlange, you are playing a deep part
but you cannot make me swallow your statements about my
father."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to expose him?"</p>
<p>"We'll see about that later. Rasco and I will certainly try to
show you up for what you really are."</p>
<p>"Very well," blustered Vorlange. "Your father is a murderer, and
he shall swing for it&#8212;unless you keep your mouth shut.
I&#8212;&#8212;"</p>
<p>Footsteps outside of the prison interrupted Louis Vorlange. An
instant later Pawnee Brown and half a dozen others stepped inside
of the apartment.</p>
<p>"Pawnee Brown!" cried Dick and Rasco together.</p>
<p>"Are you a prisoner, too?" continued the boy.</p>
<p>"Hardly," smiled the great scout. Then he noticed Vorlange.
"Just the men we are after."</p>
<p>"Me?" ejaculated the spy.</p>
<p>"Yes, you."</p>
<p>"What do you want of me, Pawnee Brown? I want nothing to do with
such as you&#8212;a thieving, low-down
boomer&#8212;who&#8212;oh!"</p>
<p>Vorlange ended with a yell, for Pawnee Brown had caught him by
the ear and almost jerked him off his feet.</p>
<p>"Let up! Let up! Oh!"</p>
<p>"Now keep quiet Vorlange," said the scout sternly. "You can
thank your stars that I didn't put a bullet through you for letting
your tongue run so loosely."</p>
<p>"Thet's so, b'gosh," was Rasco's comment. "But say, Pawnee, he's
a reg'lar snake in the grass."</p>
<p>"I know it." Pawnee Brown looked at Dick. "Has he been
threatening you, lad?"</p>
<p>"Yes; threatened me and my father, too."</p>
<p>"Have no fear of him, Dick. Louis Vorlange, you have about
reached the end of your rope."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" and the spy's lips quivered as he spoke.</p>
<p>"I mean that I am here to expose you." Pawnee Brown turned to
the others who had come in. "Gentlemen, let me introduce to you
Louis Vorlange, alias Captain Mull, once of Creede, Colorado."</p>
<p>"Captain Mull!" exclaimed several. "Do you mean the Captain Mull
that was wanted for several shady doings, Pawnee?"</p>
<p>"The same Captain Mull, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"It is a&#8212;a lie!" screamed Louis Vorlange, but his looks
belied him.</p>
<p>"It is the truth, gentlemen, he is the man who once sported
under the name of Captain Mull. But that is not all."</p>
<p>"What else, Pawnee?"</p>
<p>"Some years ago a man by the name of Andrew Rickwell was
murdered in the Last Chance hotel at Creede. At that time Creede
was but a small place and Captain Mull ran the hotel. Who murdered
Rickwell was not discovered. But he had occupied a room with
another man, a mining agent from New York named Mortimer Arbuckle,
the father of this lad here, and some thought Arbuckle had done the
foul deed, and he had to run away to escape the fury of a mob. The
horror of this occurrence unbalanced the man's mind and to this day
he sometimes thinks he may be guilty. But he is innocent."</p>
<p>"He is guilty!" shrieked Louis Vorlange. "I saw him do the
deed!"</p>
<p>"I see you acknowledge you were in Creede at that time,"
answered Pawnee Bill, and Vorlange staggered back over the bad
break he had made. "As I said, Mortimer Arbuckle is innocent. There
is the murderer, and here are the documents to prove it&#8212;and
to prove more&#8212;that Vorlange is a thief, that he assaulted
Mortimer Arbuckle in the dark and left him for dead, and that he is
now acting against the best interests of the United States
government."</p>
<p>As Pawnee Brown ended he pointed at Vorlange, and held aloft the
packet he had taken from Yellow Elk.</p>
<p>"My father's documents!" cried Dick.</p>
<p>"The letters!" shrieked Louis Vorlange. Then he made a sudden
leap to secure them, but Pawnee Brown was too quick for him. The
scout turned to the captain of cavalry standing near.</p>
<p>"You had better arrest him before he tries to escape."</p>
<p>"They shall not arrest me!" came from Louis Vorlange's set lips.
"Clear the way!"</p>
<p>Like a flash his pistol came up and he fired into the crowd,
which parted in surprise and let him pass. But not more than ten
steps were covered when Pawnee Brown caught him by the arm and
threw him headlong to the ground. At the same time the prison
sentry fired, and Vorlange was mortally wounded in the side.</p>
<p>"I'll not forget you!" he cried to Pawnee Brown. "But for you I
would have lived in clover the balance of my life!" Then he fell
into a faint from which he recovered presently, to linger for
several days in terrible anguish, dying at last in convulsions.</p>
<p>With the death of Vorlange we bring our story to a close. By
what was said during the man's last hours on earth, Mortimer
Arbuckle was entirely cleared of the cloud which had hung over his
honorable name. Soon after this his right mind came back to him and
to-day he is as well and happy as it is possible to imagine.</p>
<p>Whatever became of Stillwater and Juan Donomez is not known.</p>
<p>With the truce declared by the actions of the authorities at
Washington and the word given by Pawnee Brown that no attempt
should be made to enter Oklahoma for the present, it was not deemed
advisable to hold either Dick or Rasco longer, and the two were
given their freedom, to journey at once to Honnewell, in company
with the great scout and Nellie Winthrop.</p>
<p>From Honnewell, Dick rode post haste to carry the glad news to
his father. A scene followed which no pen can describe, a scene so
sacred to the two it must be left entirely to the imagination of
the reader. Never was a man more proud of his son than was Mortimer
Arbuckle of Dick, or more grateful than was the mine-owner to
Pawnee Brown for his courageous and marvelous work in clearing up
the mystery.</p>
<p>"He is a man among men," he said. "God bless him!"</p>
<p>Nellie Winthrop was overjoyed to be with her uncle once again,
and took good care that nothing should separate them. As for Jack,
he guarded her with a care which could not be exceeded.</p>
<p>"Ef they carry her off again it will be over my dead body,
b'gosh," he murmured more than once.</p>
<p>And yet Nellie was carried off four years later. But this time
the carrying off was done by Dick Arbuckle, and both Nellie and
Jack were perfectly willing. The wedding was a grand one, for the
Colorado claims had panned out big for the Arbuckles, and the best
man at the affair was Pawnee Brown.</p>
<p>In due course of time the bill concerning Oklahoma was passed by
the United States Senate and signed by the President. This was
followed by a grand rush of the boomers to get the best of the land
granted to them. The advance was led by Pawnee Brown, who, riding
his ever faithful Bonnie Bird, covered twenty miles in the short
space of sixty-five minutes and located his town site at the mouth
of Big Turkey Creek. This town site, along with his other Oklahoma
possessions, made the great scout a rich man. He never grows weary
of telling about this great rush into Oklahoma. "It was grand,
awe-inspiring," he says. "I would go a thousand miles to see it
again&#8212;those hundreds of wagons, thousands of horsemen and
heads of cattle, all going southward, over hills, through forests,
crossing brooks and rivers&#8212;all bound for the land which has
since made them so prosperous and happy."</p>
<p>And here let us take leave of Dick Arbuckle, Pawnee Brown, and
all their friends, wishing them well.</p>
